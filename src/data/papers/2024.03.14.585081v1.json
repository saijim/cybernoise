However, its role beyond being an antioxidant has remained largely unknown. A recent study by scientists from the University of Amsterdam has shed light on this mystery and found that chloroplastic ascorbate acts as a regulatory hub in plant metabolism, regardless of oxidative stress.\n\nThe researchers studied chloroplastic ascorbate-transporter pht4;4 mutant lines and the ascorbate-deficient vtc2-4 mutant of Arabidopsis thaliana to investigate the consequences of chloroplastic and total cellular ascorbate-deficiencies. Surprisingly, they found that under regular growth conditions, both ascorbate-deficiencies caused minor alterations in photosynthesis with no apparent signs of oxidative damage.\n\nHowever, a metabolomics analysis revealed a global and largely overlapping metabolome rewiring in both ascorbate-deficiencies, suggesting that chloroplastic ascorbate modulates plant metabolism. The study found significant alterations in amino acid metabolism, particularly in arginine metabolism, activation of nucleotide salvage pathways, and changes in secondary metabolism.\n\nFurthermore, a proteome-wide analysis of thermostability revealed that ascorbate may interact with enzymes involved in arginine metabolism, the Calvin-Benson cycle, and several photosynthetic electron transport components. These findings suggest that chloroplastic ascorbate interconnects and coordinates diverse metabolic pathways in vascular plants.\n\nOverall, this study challenges our previous understanding of the role of ascorbate and opens up new avenues for research in plant biology. The discovery of chloroplastic ascorbate as a regulatory hub could lead to the development of new strategies to improve crop yield and stress tolerance.","title":"Chloroplastic Ascorbate: A Newly Discovered Regulatory Hub in Plant Metabolism","link":"http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2024.03.14.585081v1?rss=1","id":"2024.03.14.585081v1","slug":"chloroplastic-ascorbate-a-newly-discovered-regulatory-hub-in-plant-metabolism","creator":"Toth, D., Tengolics, R., Aarabi, F., Karlsson, A., Vidal-Meireles, A., Kovacs, L., Kuntam, S., Kormoczi, T., Fernie, A.
