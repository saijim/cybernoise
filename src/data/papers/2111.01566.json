{"title":"A New Era of Fair Facility Location: Strategyproof and Proportionally Just Solutions","summary":"Revolutionary research on facility location problems! Discover the power of proportionally fair solutions and the uniqueness of the Uniform Phantom mechanism.","intro":"Imagine a world where facility location decisions are made with perfect fairness and no room for manipulation - welcome to the future of collective decision making! Our groundbreaking study explores the frontiers of strategyproof and proportionally fair facility location, revealing the secrets to achieving optimal social welfare and minimum total cost. Get ready to be amazed by the simplicity and efficiency of our innovative approach!","text":"In this paper, we delve into the fascinating realm of one-dimensional collective decision problems, tackling issues of strategyproofness and proportionality-based fairness. By examining a hierarchy of fairness axioms, we uncover the equivalence of certain mechanisms and identify the unique Uniform Phantom mechanism as the ultimate solution provider. Our findings not only ensure strategic fairness but also offer superior approximation guarantees, leading to the best possible outcomes in terms of social welfare and total cost. Embrace the dawn of a new era in facility location decision making!","keywords":["facility location","strategyproofness","proportional fairness","Uniform Phantom mechanism"],"prompt":"Envision a futuristic society where decisions are made with flawless fairness and cutting-edge technology. Imagine a city skyline with sleek, high-tech facilities, each one chosen with precise reasoning and utmost fairness. The Uniform Phantom mechanism is the driving force behind this vision, ensuring that every decision is made with the greater good in mind. With our research, we pave the way for a brighter future, where collective decision making is both efficient and just.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2111.01566","id":"2111.01566","slug":"a-new-era-of-fair-facility-location-strategyproof-and-proportionally-just-solutions","creator":"Haris Aziz, Alexander Lam, Barton E.
