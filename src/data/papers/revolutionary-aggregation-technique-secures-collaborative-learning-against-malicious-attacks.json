  "summary": "A novel aggregation approach based on recursive Euclidean distance calculation secures federated learning against malicious attacks while improving the accuracy of the global model.",
  "intro": "Are you concerned about the safety of your data in collaborative machine learning? Malicious attacks, such as backdoor poisoning, label-flipping, and membership inference, can sabotage the learning process and compromise the accuracy of the global model. But fear not! A group of researchers have developed a revolutionary aggregation technique based on recursive Euclidean distance calculation that addresses this critical issue!",
