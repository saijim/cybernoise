No cash, no cards, just digital money backed by the government. This is the future of finance, and it's coming sooner than you think. Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) are set to revolutionize the way we think about money, providing households with a secure and efficient way to access liquidity. But what does this mean for the financial system as a whole? In this article, we'll explore how CBDCs could promote financial stability, while also expanding credit to firms and changing the business model of banks forever. The traditional banking system is built on commercial bank deposits, which provide households with a source of liquidity. However, with the introduction of CBDCs, households now have an alternative way to access cash. This raises concerns about the impact on financial stability, as well as the potential for bank disintermediation and instability. But what if we told you that this doesn't have to be the case? In fact, our research suggests that CBDCs could actually promote financial stability, while also expanding credit to firms. The key lies in the collateral constraint faced by banks when borrowing from the central bank. By introducing a CBDC, the central bank can ensure the same equilibrium allocation and price system as before, but with one major difference: banks must now hold government bonds as collateral in order to access loans. This may seem like a limitation, but it actually has a number of benefits. For one, it allows the central bank to assume part of the credit-extension role, reducing the risk of financial instability. At the same time, it incentivizes banks to extend more credit to firms, promoting economic growth and development. But that's not all. Our research also shows that an increase in CBDCs can actually foster an expansion of bank credit to firms, rather than leading to disintermediation and instability. This is because banks are able to use the CBDC as a way to reduce their liquidity risk, freeing up more capital to lend to firms. The implications are huge. With CBDCs, we could see a future where financial stability is promoted, credit is expanded, and economic growth is accelerated. It's a future where money is digital, secure, and efficient, and where households have access to the cash they need, when they need it. So what does this mean for you? It means that the way you think about money is about to change forever. It means that you'll have more control over your finances, more security in your transactions, and more opportunities for economic growth. The future of finance is here, and it's brighter than ever.","title":"Central Bank Digital Currency with Collateral-constrained Banks: A New Era for Financial Stability","link":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.10359","id":"2308.10359","slug":"central-bank-digital-currency-with-collateral-constrained-banks-a-new-era-for-financial-stability","creator":"Hanfeng Chen, Maria Elena Filippin","topic":"economics"}
