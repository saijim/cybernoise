Shiraz grapevines.","text":"Grapevine Shiraz Disease (SD) is a major threat to vineyards in Australia and South Africa, significantly reducing yield. However, the mechanisms behind SD's impact on plant physiology, transcriptional modifications, and fruit composition remain unclear. Researchers examined Vitis vinifera L. cv. Shiraz vines grown in a commercial vineyard in South Australia over two growing seasons to understand SD's effects better.\n\nSD did not affect the grapevines' water status but resulted in smaller canopies, reduced leaf gas exchange, chlorophyll fluorescence, and lower yield. Viruses associated with SD were identified using serological (ELISA) and molecular tests (PCR and Illumina next generation sequencing).\n\nGene expression analysis revealed significantly higher systemic acquired resistance (SAR)-associated gene expression in phloem tissues of SD-infected grapevines. Simultaneously, defence-related genes were downregulated, as were photosynthesis-related genes.\n\nThis study provides the first comprehensive report on the physiological and transcriptomic responses of grapevine to SD, paving the way for potential solutions to mitigate yield losses caused by this destructive disease.","title":"Unraveling Grapevine Shiraz Disease: How Gene Expression Changes Result in Significant Yield Losses","link":"http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2024.03.18.585633v1?rss=1","id":"2024.03.18.585633v1","slug":"unraveling-grapevine-shiraz-disease-how-gene-expression-changes-result-in-significant-yield-losses","creator":"Nagahatenna, D., Onetto, C.
