{"title":"GPT-4 with Vision Outperforms Humans in Aesthetic Evaluation","summary":"A new study reveals GPT-4 with Vision's superior ability to predict aesthetic evaluations compared to humans.","intro":"In a groundbreaking study, researchers have discovered that GPT-4 with Vision, a state-of-the-art language model that can process image input, outperforms humans in the task of aesthetic evaluation. The study employed two tasks: predicting the average evaluation values of a group and an individual's evaluation values.","text":"The researchers found that GPT-4 with Vision demonstrated superior performance in predicting aesthetic evaluations compared to human participants. Specifically, the model was able to accurately predict the average evaluation values of a group as well as an individual's evaluation values. Furthermore, the study revealed that GPT-4 with Vision responded differently to beauty and ugliness, suggesting that it has a nuanced understanding of aesthetics.","keywords":["GPT-4","Vision","aesthetic evaluation","artificial intelligence"],"prompt":"A high-tech laboratory with a large computer screen displaying an image of a beautiful landscape, a group of researchers analyzing data and discussing the results, a robot with human-like features and expressive eyes observing the discussion","link":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03594","id":"2403.03594","slug":"gpt-4-with-vision-outperforms-humans-in-aesthetic-evaluation","creator":"Yoshia Abe, Tatsuya Daikoku, Yasuo Kuniyoshi","topic":"artificial-intelligence"}
