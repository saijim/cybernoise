{"title":"Unlocking the true potential of causal relationships in political science with instrumental variable estimates","summary":"Researchers replicate over 60 studies in political science and provide practical advice on the best practices for using instrumental variable estimates.","intro":"Instrumental variable strategies have been found to be an effective method for establishing causal relationships, but researchers have struggled with accurately assessing their validity. However, using more robust inferential methods, new research provides hope for better unlocking the true potential of these causal relationships in the field of political science.","keywords":["instrumental variable","causal relationship","political science","replication","validity"],"prompt":"a futuristic political science lab with researchers using advanced technology to analyze data and establish causal relationships.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11399","id":"702bdbb8ba12fc21bcae4529a56dd9c3","slug":"unlocking-the-true-potential-of-causal-relationships-in-political-science-with-instrumental-variable-estimates","imageSlug":"an-image-of-a-futuristic-political-science-lab-with-researchers-using-advanced-technology-to-analyze-data-and-establish-causal-relationships","creator":"Apoorva Lal, Mac Lockhart, Yiqing Xu, Ziwen Zu"}
