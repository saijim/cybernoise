The results showed that both SG and LG treatments led to enhanced nutritional uptake, resulting in increased biomass, foliage density, plant height, and root development. These findings suggest that amino acid treatments could be used as powerful bio-stimulants to improve crop yield, particularly in challenging agricultural conditions. While further research is needed to determine the long-term benefits of each treatment, the results of this study offer a promising new approach to improving plant growth and resilience.","title":"Revolutionary Discovery: Seaweed and Amino Acids Boost Coriander Growth in Guangzhou, China","link":"http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2024.03.18.585645v1?rss=1","id":"2024.03.18.585645v1","slug":"revolutionary-discovery-seaweed-and-amino-acids-boost-coriander-growth-in-guangzhou-china","creator":"Chen, X., Shang, Z., Chen, H., Wan, S.","topic":"plant-biology"}
