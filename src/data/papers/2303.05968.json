{"title":"Breakthrough Impossibility Theorem Proves Social Choices Must Be Dictatorial!","summary":"New theorem reveals that fairness and truthfulness in social choices are only possible when decisions are dictated by a single person.","intro":"Get ready for a groundbreaking revelation in the world of social choice theory! A team of brilliant researchers has just uncovered a shocking truth that challenges our understanding of fairness, incentives, and decision-making. Their new theorem reveals that there's a general impossibility for achieving both Pareto efficiency and Bayesian incentive compatibility when making collective decisions without monetary transfers.","text":"In this groundbreaking paper, the researchers study a vast class of social choice problems where agents' preferences are privately observable random variables. They focus on cardinal social choice functions that take into account not only preference rankings but also preference intensities.\n\nHere's the jaw-dropping part: they prove that a social choice function can be simultaneously ex ante Pareto efficient and Bayesian incentive compatible if and only if it is dictatorial! This result holds true for any number of agents and alternatives, as long as a relatively mild assumption about the joint distribution of types is metâ€”an assumption that allows for arbitrary correlations and asymmetries.\n\nThis discovery has profound implications for the design of fair and truthful social choice mechanisms in various domains, from voting systems to resource allocation and auctions. It suggests that when we aim for Pareto efficiency and incentive compatibility without monetary transfers, we must accept some level of dictatorship in our decision-making processes.\n\nThis theorem is a stark reminder that the quest for fairness and truthfulness in social choices comes with its own set of challenges. It's a call to action for researchers and policymakers to find innovative ways to balance these objectives while minimizing potential drawbacks.","keywords":["impossibility theorem","social choice theory","Pareto efficiency","Bayesian incentive compatibility","dictatorship"],"prompt":{"description":"An illustration of a futuristic, digital cityscape with a single, enormous hand pointing downwards from the sky, symbolizing the concept of dictatorial decision-making in social choices.","style":"cyberpunk","size":"1024x1024"},"link":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.05968","id":"2303.05968","slug":"breakthrough-impossibility-theorem-proves-social-choices-must-be-dictatorial","creator":"Kazuya Kikuchi, Yukio Koriyama","topic":"economics"}
