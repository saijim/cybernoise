This utopian vision is fast becoming a reality thanks to the groundbreaking concept of Explainable Interfaces (EI) in Human-Autonomy Teaming (HAT). As we increasingly rely on large-scale foundation models in safety-critical applications like transportation, medicine, and defense, it's essential to foster mutual understanding and trust between humans and machines. The 'black-box' nature of sophisticated deep neural networks has long been a hurdle, but EI is poised to revolutionize the way we interact with autonomous systems. In this exciting survey, we delve into the uncharted territory of EI in HAT systems from a human-centric perspective, shedding light on the design, development, and evaluation of these innovative interfaces. By clarifying the distinctions between EI, explanations, and model explainability, researchers and practitioners can gain a structured understanding of this complex domain. A novel framework for EI is proposed, addressing the unique challenges in HAT, while a comprehensive evaluation framework provides a holistic perspective on model performance, human-centered factors, and group task objectives. The result? Multiple novel insights into incorporating Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) into HAT systems, paving the way for a future where humans and machines collaborate seamlessly.
