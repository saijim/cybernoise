This future is now one step closer thanks to a revolutionary study that has uncovered hidden stem cell regulators in plants, paving the way for super crops. By using single-cell RNA-seq profiling on finely dissected stem cell-enriched shoot tissues from both maize and arabidopsis, researchers identified conserved stem cell regulators between the two species.","text":"Stem cells in plant shoots are a rare population of cells that produce leaves, fruits, and seeds, vital sources for food and bioethanol. Uncovering regulators expressed in these stem cells is crucial for crop engineering to boost productivity. However, accessing plant shoot stem cells is challenging, and recent single-cell analyses of plant shoots have not captured these cells, failing to detect stem cell regulators like CLAVATA3 and WUSCHEL.\n\nIn this study, researchers finely dissected stem cell-enriched shoot tissues from both maize and arabidopsis for single-cell RNA-seq profiling. They optimized protocols to efficiently recover thousands of CLAVATA3 and WUSCHEL expressed cells, which were not detected in previous studies.\n\nA cross-species comparison identified conserved stem cell regulators between maize and arabidopsis, indicating that these regulators may be crucial for shoot development in various crops. Additionally, single-cell RNA-seq was performed on maize stem cell overproliferation mutants to find additional candidate regulators.\n\nExpression of candidate stem cell genes was validated using spatial transcriptomics, and researchers functionally confirmed their roles in shoot development. These candidates include a family of ribosome-associated RNA-binding proteins, and two families of sugar kinase genes related to hypoxia signaling and cytokinin hormone homeostasis.\n\nThese large-scale single-cell profiling of stem cells provide a resource for mining stem cell regulators, which show significant association with yield traits. Overall, this study advances the understanding of shoot development and opens avenues for manipulating diverse crops to enhance food and energy security.","keywords":["stem cells","plant shoots","single-cell RNA-seq profiling","crop engineering","yield traits"],"prompt":"A futuristic image of a green field with super crops, showing healthy and abundant yields, with a magnified view of stem cells in the plant shoots","link":"http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2024.03.04.583414v1?rss=1","id":"2024.03.04.583414v1","slug":"revolutionary-study-uncovers-hidden-stem-cell-regulators-in-plants-paving-way-for-super-crops","creator":"Xu, X., Passalacqua, M., Rice, B., Demesa-Arevalo, E., Kojima, M., Takebayashi, Y., Harris, B., Sakakibara, H., Gallavotti, A., Gillis, J., Jackson, D.","topic":"plant-biology"}
