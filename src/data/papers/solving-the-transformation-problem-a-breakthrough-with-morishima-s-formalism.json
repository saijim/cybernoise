{"title":"Solving the Transformation Problem: A Breakthrough with Morishima's Formalism!","summary":"Discover how both of Marx's invariant principles can be used to correctly determine commodity prices and solve the transformation problem through Morishima's formalism.","intro":"Are you tired of not being able to accurately determine the true value of a commodity? Look no further! Thanks to Michio Morishima's method and its variations, the unit value of any commodity can now be correctly determined. And if that wasn't enough, a simple reproduction system without fixed capital can now be solved with both of Marx's invariant principles. Read on to learn how to revolutionize your understanding of commodity value!","keywords":["Marx","value","commodity","Morishima","transformation problem"],"prompt":"futuristic robots accurately determining the value of commodities in a bustling marketplace","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11471","id":"ebd62b00996da73b5293f42f82cc69ce","slug":"solving-the-transformation-problem-a-breakthrough-with-morishima-s-formalism","imageSlug":"an-image-of-futuristic-robots-accurately-determining-the-value-of-commodities-in-a-bustling-marketplace","creator":"Norbert Ankri, Pa&#xef;kan Marcaggi"}
