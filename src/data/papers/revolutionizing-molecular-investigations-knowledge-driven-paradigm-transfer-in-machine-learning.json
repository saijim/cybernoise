Through the power of sophisticated algorithms and large datasets, it has unlocked unprecedented insights and capabilities. And this holds particularly true for molecular investigations within the biochemical sphere. Traditionally, researchers have relied on a handful of paradigms to model and predict molecular properties. These paradigms, such as the prediction paradigm, have paved the way for significant advancements in our understanding of the molecular world. \n\nHowever, as the complexity of molecular systems and datasets grew, so did the need for more comprehensive and interpretable models. This led to the integration of biochemical domain knowledge into molecular study models, giving rise to knowledge-informed molecular learning. Instead of relying solely on the data, scientists began leveraging their deep understanding of biochemical principles to guide and enhance the learning process.\n\nEnter paradigm transfer. This groundbreaking approach involves reformulating one molecular learning task as another, utilizing the knowledge gained from different paradigms. By doing so, researchers are able to tap into a wealth of insights and create harmonized models that bridge the gaps between different domains of molecular research. The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) has further accelerated this trend, enabling unparalleled unification and synergy between paradigms.\n\nIn our comprehensive literature survey, we explore the world of knowledge-informed molecular learning from the perspective of paradigm transfer. We begin by classifying the different paradigms used in molecular investigations and dive deep into their methodologies. From molecular property prediction to molecular synthesis planning, each paradigm brings its own unique contribution to the scientific landscape.\n\nBut it's the integration of domain knowledge that truly sets this approach apart. Scientists are now able to fuse their expertise in biochemistry, genetics, and other related fields with the power of machine learning. They are deciphering the complex language of molecules with astonishing accuracy and pushing the boundaries of what is possible in molecular research.\n\nAs we delve deeper into our survey, we uncover prevailing trends that are shaping the future of molecular learning. The synergistic fusion of domain knowledge and data-driven models is creating a paradigm shift in scientific investigations. With each passing day, we inch closer to a future where researchers will have a comprehensive understanding of molecular behavior and the ability to design novel molecules with desired properties.\n\nBut the journey doesn't end here. Our survey also highlights intriguing avenues for future exploration in molecular learning, paving the way for even more breakthroughs. The potential of knowledge-driven paradigm transfer is vast and far-reaching. From advancing drug discovery to revolutionizing materials science, its impact transcends traditional boundaries and opens up a world of possibilities.\n\nSo, fasten your seatbelts as we embark on this exhilarating journey into the realm of knowledge-driven molecular learning. The future of scientific discovery awaits, and it's more exciting than ever before!","keywords":["molecular investigations","paradigm transfer","knowledge-driven","data-driven models","biochemical domain knowledge"],"prompt":"A futuristic image depicting the harmonious integration of machine learning and biochemistry, symbolizing the revolution in molecular investigations.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2202.10587","id":"f7b7fcd39c64b4336a781e47bfef6fec","slug":"revolutionizing-molecular-investigations-knowledge-driven-paradigm-transfer-in-machine-learning","creator":"Yin Fang, Zhuo Chen, Xiaohui Fan, Ningyu Zhang","topic":"artificial-intelligence"}
