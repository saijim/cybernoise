Where they can adapt to new situations, new environments, and new concepts with ease. This is not just a dream of science fiction anymore, but a reality that is fast approaching. With the help of Adaptive Discovering and Merging (ADM), machines are now able to discover and learn novel classes from unlabelled data in a continuous manner.","text":"Lifelong learning, or the ability for machines to learn continuously throughout their lifetime, is one of the most important goals in artificial intelligence. However, it comes with its own set of challenges. One such challenge is the discovery and learning of novel classes from unlabelled data in a continuous manner, while mitigating the issue of catastrophic forgetting of established knowledge.\n\nTo address this challenge, researchers have introduced a new paradigm called Adaptive Discovering and Merging (ADM). ADM is designed to discover novel categories adaptively in the incremental stage and integrate novel knowledge into the model without affecting the original knowledge.\n\nThe key to ADM's success lies in its ability to decouple representation learning and novel class discovery. By doing so, it can use Triple Comparison (TC) and Probability Regularization (PR) to constrain the probability discrepancy and diversity for adaptive category assignment. This allows the model to discover novel classes adaptively and learn from them in a continuous manner.\n\nIn addition to its ability to discover novel classes adaptively, ADM also proposes a hybrid structure with base and novel branches named Adaptive Model Merging (AMM). This structure reduces the interference of the novel branch on the old classes, allowing the model to preserve previous knowledge. Furthermore, it merges the novel branch to the base model without performance loss or parameter growth.\n\nExtensive experiments have shown that ADM significantly outperforms existing class-incremental Novel Class Discovery (class-iNCD) approaches. Moreover, its AMM also benefits the class-incremental Learning (class-IL) task by alleviating the catastrophic forgetting problem.\n\nIn summary, Adaptive Discovering and Merging (ADM) is a groundbreaking new paradigm that allows machines to discover and learn novel classes from unlabelled data in a continuous manner. With its ability to decouple representation learning and novel class discovery, and its proposed Adaptive Model Merging (AMM) structure, ADM represents a significant step forward in the field of lifelong learning.","keywords":["Adaptive Discovering and Merging","lifelong learning","novel classes","unlabelled data","class-incremental Novel Class Discovery"],"prompt":"A cyberpunk cityscape with a machine learning model discovering new classes in the background","link":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03382","id":"2403.03382","slug":"discovering-and-merging-new-classes-for-lifelong-learning","creator":"Guangyao Chen, Peixi Peng, Yangru Huang, Mengyue Geng, Yonghong Tian","topic":"artificial-intelligence"}
