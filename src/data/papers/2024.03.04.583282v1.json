{"title":"Heat-Induced NATA2 Enzyme Unlocks Stress Tolerance in Arabidopsis","summary":"Discover how the newly identified heat-responsive NATA2 enzyme enhances Arabidopsis' growth and pathogen defence under high temperatures, revealing a novel metabolite-based stress regulation mechanism.","intro":"In the quest to understand plant resilience in extreme environments, researchers have stumbled upon an intriguing heat-responsive enzyme that could hold the key to unlocking stress tolerance in Arabidopsis. The discovery of this enzyme, NATA2, and its role in regulating polyamine abundance unveils a novel paradigm for non-genetic feedback regulation of plant enzymes.","text":"Polyamines are essential molecules present in various organisms, including bacteria, plants, and animals, playing critical roles in growth, development, and stress responses. N-acetyltransferases (NATs) regulate polyamine abundance by catalysing their N-acetylation, thereby reducing the pool of polyamines and producing other bioactive components. However, the regulatory mechanisms controlling SSAT enzymes are not entirely clear.\n\nA recent study published in The Plant Journal sheds light on the biological role and regulation of the two SSAT isoforms present in Arabidopsis thaliana, N-ACETYLTRANSFERASE ACTIVITY (NATA) 1 and 2. Researchers demonstrated that NATA2 is a heat-stable isoform, induced in response to high temperatures.\n\nSurprisingly, the nata2 knockout mutation proved beneficial for growth and pathogen defence under heat stress in Arabidopsis, aligning with the stress-mitigating effect of polyamines. In contrast, the double knockout of nata1 and nata2 was lethal, highlighting the essential role of basal SSAT activity.\n\nTo further explore this phenomenon, researchers generated numerous crystal structures of both NATAs and performed functional assays. They found that stress-produced acidic metabolites can selectively inhibit polyamine acetylation by occupying the NATA substrate-binding pocket. This environment-responsive regulation mechanism may allow Arabidopsis to adjust the deleterious action of NATAs under stress conditions, without eliminating the enzyme.\n\nThe study suggests that metabolite-ensemble inhibition could be a novel paradigm for non-genetic feedback regulation of plant enzymes, offering new insights into how plants adapt to changing environmental conditions.","keywords":["Arabidopsis thaliana","NATA1","NATA2","polyamine acetylation","heat stress"],"prompt":"Colorful illustration of Arabidopsis thaliana plant with NATA2 enzyme molecules in the foreground, shown as translucent spheres with heat waves emanating from them","link":"http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2024.03.04.583282v1?rss=1","id":"2024.03.04.583282v1","slug":"heat-induced-nata2-enzyme-unlocks-stress-tolerance-in-arabidopsis","creator":"Hameed, U.
