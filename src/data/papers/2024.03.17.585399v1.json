This discovery could have major implications for the way we grow and cultivate this important global cash crop, potentially leading to higher yields and improved quality.\n\nThe study, conducted using a compartmentalized culture system, found that the contribution of AMF to plant nitrogen was 10.40, 22.72, and 16.67% under high, low, and no nitrogen treatments, respectively. Under low-nitrogen conditions, the symbiosis between AMF and roots increased root surface area, tip number, branch number, mean diameter, and biomass; and increased soil extracellular enzyme activity (protease, NAG, PER, and PPO), the microbial biomass carbon-to-nitrogen ratio, active carbon content, and the soil nitrogen mineralization rate. Soil NO3--N, NH4+-N, and organic nitrogen content decreased, whereas the absorption of NO3--N by AMF hyphae was higher than that of NH4+-N.\n\nThese findings suggest that under low-nitrogen conditions, AMF can promote the decomposition of soil organic matter and the transformation of soil nitrogen through the action of hyphal microorganisms. This in turn leads to improved nitrogen uptake in cotton plants, resulting in higher yields and better quality crops.\n\nThe researchers believe that their findings could have significant implications for the future of cotton cultivation, particularly in regions where low-nitrogen conditions are common. By harnessing the power of AMF, farmers may be able to grow stronger, healthier cotton plants with less reliance on synthetic fertilizers and other chemical inputs.\n\nOverall, this study represents a major breakthrough in our understanding of how AMF can benefit cotton plants under low-nitrogen conditions. As we continue to explore the potential of these fascinating fungi, it's clear that they have a lot to offer when it comes to improving crop yields and sustainability.","title":"Arbuscular Mycorrhizal Fungi Boost Nitrogen Uptake in Cotton Plants Under Low-Nitrogen Conditions","link":"http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2024.03.17.585399v1?rss=1","id":"2024.03.17.585399v1","slug":"arbuscular-mycorrhizal-fungi-boost-nitrogen-uptake-in-cotton-plants-under-low-nitrogen-conditions","creator":"Wang, H., wang, y., cheng, X., He, Y., shen, z., zhang, W., pu, x.","topic":"plant-biology"}
