{"title":"Unlocking Randomness: How Ambiguity Aversion Can Lead to Chaos in Duopoly Markets","summary":"Discover how relaxing the perfect foresight hypothesis in duopoly markets can lead to chaotic dynamics and unlock new opportunities for profit.","intro":"Imagine a world where the rules of the game change constantly, creating endless possibilities for profit and growth. That's the future of duopoly markets, thanks to the power of ambiguity aversion and the loss of stability in the traditional Cournot-Nash equilibrium. Join us on a journey into the unknown, where chaos breeds opportunity and firms must adapt to survive.","text":"In this groundbreaking study, we explore the impact of ambiguity aversion on the global dynamics of duopoly markets. By examining the worst-case approach to uncertainty, we uncover the emergence of coexisting attractors, disconnected basins of attractions, and chaotic dynamics. This game-changing research reveals that chaos is not just a challenge, but an opportunity for firms to thrive in a constantly evolving marketplace. Embrace the randomness and take control of your destiny!","keywords":["duopoly markets","ambiguity aversion","chaotic dynamics","profit uncertainty"],"prompt":"A futuristic cityscape with neon lights and flying cars, symbolizing the exciting possibilities of a chaotic and ever-changing marketplace.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.11366","id":"2311.11366","slug":"unlocking-randomness-how-ambiguity-aversion-can-lead-to-chaos-in-duopoly-markets","creator":"Davide Radi, Laura Gardini","topic":"economics"}
