{"title":"The Future is Connected: A New Mapping of Technological Interdependence","summary":"A groundbreaking study reveals how interconnectedness fuels innovation in various sectors.","intro":"In a world where technology reigns supreme, understanding the intricate relationships between different sectors and their capacity to innovate is more crucial than ever. A recent study sheds light on this complex issue by examining two dimensions of technological interdependence: knowledge interdependence and structural interdependence.","text":"The researchers analyzed 6.5 million patents granted by the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) between 1976 and 2021 using novel methods of text mining and network analysis. Their findings reveal that both dimensions of technological interdependence have a positive impact on sector innovation.\n\nKnowledge interdependence, which includes knowledge spillovers and technological complementarities, has a slightly larger long-term effect on innovation. However, structural interdependence, or the linkages between intersectoral networks, produces more substantial and enduring effects on innovation performance in a relatively short time frame.\n\nMoreover, the study highlights that patent text contains valuable information often overlooked by traditional innovation metrics such as patent citations. This wealth of data can provide critical insights into how technological advancements impact various sectors.","keywords":["technological interdependence","innovation","knowledge spillovers","network analysis","patent text mining"],"prompt":"A futuristic cyberpunk cityscape with interconnected neon-lit skyscrapers representing technological interdependence and innovation.","link":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.00014","id":"2308.00014","slug":"the-future-is-connected-a-new-mapping-of-technological-interdependence","creator":"A.
