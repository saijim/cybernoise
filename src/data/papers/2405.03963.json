That's why researchers have been working tirelessly to develop AI solutions that can efficiently process and generate human-like responses from vast amounts of data. One such innovation is the use of large language models (LLMs) with residual augmented-generation (RAG). However, most existing systems that incorporate RAG with LLMs are limited in their scalability and generalizability, making them less effective for widespread adoption. To address this challenge, a team of innovators has proposed ERATTA - an extreme RAG system designed to overcome these limitations and take generative AI to the next level! ERATTA is a unique LLM-based system that enables multiple LLMs to work together seamlessly, allowing it to perform a range of tasks including data authentication, user query routing, data retrieval, and custom prompting for question answering capabilities. What sets ERATTA apart is its ability to extract information from large and diverse datasets, such as those found in enterprise-level data products, and provide real-time responses in under 10 seconds! The system uses a simple yet effective process involving just four prompts: one for user-to-data authentication, followed by three more to route, fetch data, and generate a customizable prompt for natural language responses. But that's not all - ERATTA also features a cutting-edge five-metric scoring module that detects and reports hallucinations in the LLM responses, ensuring the accuracy of the information provided. In testing, the system has achieved an impressive >90% confidence score across hundreds of user queries in domains such as sustainability, financial health, and social media. The implications of ERATTA are far-reaching, with potential extensions enabling heterogeneous source querying using LLMs. This means that in the future, we could see AI systems capable of querying multiple sources simultaneously, providing users with a more comprehensive understanding of complex topics. With ERATTA leading the way, the possibilities for scalable generative AI solutions seem endless! Get ready to experience the power of extreme RAG and unlock the full potential of your data!","title":"ERATTA: Extreme RAG for Table To Answers with Large Language Models","link":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03963","id":"2405.03963","slug":"eratta-extreme-rag-for-table-to-answers-with-large-language-models","creator":"Sohini Roychowdhury, Marko Krema, Anvar Mahammad, Brian Moore, Arijit Mukherjee, Punit Prakashchandra","topic":"artificial-intelligence"}
