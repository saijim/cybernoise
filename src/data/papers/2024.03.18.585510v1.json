This discovery is crucial for understanding molecular mechanisms of photosynthetic electron transport and harnessing photosynthesis for sustainable bioproduction.","text":"In a groundbreaking study, scientists have engineered the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 to express an exogenous gene for ene-reductase, YqjM. This recombinant enzyme catalyses the reduction of an added substrate into the desired product by utilizing photosynthetically produced NAD(P)H, enabling whole-cell biotransformation.\n\nThrough coupling the biotransformation reaction with biophysical measurements, researchers demonstrated that the strong artificial electron sink outcompetes natural electron valves such as the flavodiiron protein-driven Mehler-like reaction and cyclic electron transport. These results show that ferredoxin-NAD(P)H-oxidoreductase (FNR) is the preferred route for delivering photosynthetic electrons from reduced ferredoxin, and the cellular NADPH/NADP+ ratio as a key factor in orchestrating photosynthetic electron flux.\n\nThis discovery is crucial for understanding molecular mechanisms of photosynthetic electron transport and harnessing photosynthesis for sustainable bioproduction. It also highlights the importance of engineering the cellular source/sink balance, which can lead to more efficient bioproduction in the future.
