This discovery paves the way for innovative approaches in breeding disease-resistant loquat varieties.","text":"Loquat canker, a devastating bacterial disease affecting loquats (Eriobotrya japonica) worldwide, has been causing significant damage to crops. Researchers have reported three pathotypes of this disease in Japan, including group C, which poses a major challenge to loquat cultivation. The Champagne cultivar, however, offers a glimmer of hope. It exhibits natural resistance to loquat canker group C due to recessive homozygous pse-c gene located on Linkage Group 3 (LG3) and unidentified loci contributing quantitative traits.\n\nBuilding on this knowledge, a new study delves into the genetic makeup of Champagne cultivar in search of novel quantitative trait loci (QTL) regions associated with resistance. The researchers utilized a seedling population with Tanaka crossed with Champagne and constructed a genetic map that covers 1,301 cM and includes 1,016 SNP markers across 17 LGs.\n\nThe results revealed significant findings. Alongside minor potential QTLs, the team identified a major QTL for resistance to loquat canker group C in the upper region of LG14. This specific QTL contributes approximately 6.9% to the disease index.\n\nThis pioneering study marks an important milestone in developing disease-resistant loquat varieties. By unlocking new resistance QTL regions, researchers open up a world of possibilities for breeders and farmers to harness these genetic advantages and safeguard crops against this destructive disease.","keywords":["loquat canker","Pseudomonas syringae pv. eriobotryae group C","Champagne cultivar","resistance QTL regions","breeding"],"prompt":"An illustration of a loquat tree with glowing, highlighted genetic markers on its leaves and branches, symbolizing the discovered resistance QTL regions against loquat canker","link":"http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2024.03.04.583427v1?rss=1","id":"2024.03.04.583427v1","slug":"unlocking-new-defenses-against-loquat-canker-discovering-resistance-qtl-regions-in-champagne-cultivar","creator":"Koga, S., Kawaguchi, R., Tanaka, T., Moriya, S., Hiehata, N., Kabashima, K., Nagano, A.
