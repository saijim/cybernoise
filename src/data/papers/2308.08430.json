The research, published on arXiv, introduces the core support criterion, a voting criterion that is analogous to the Condorcet criterion but reflects a different majority rule philosophy.\n\nUnlike traditional Condorcet methods, which conduct elections between each pair of candidates and count all ballots to determine the winner, IRV only counts ballots from voters who do not prefer another major candidate. This is determined self-consistently from the IRV social ranking.\n\nThe study argues that whether to include all ballots or a subset of ballots for a pair-election depends on whether society deems the entire or selected ballot set in compliance with freedom of association, which implies freedom of non-association, for a given pair election. This argument is based on more information about an electorate than can be learned from ranked ballots alone.\n\nThe authors present a freedom-of-association based argument to explain why IRV may be preferable to Condorcet in some circumstances, including the 2022 Alaska special congressional election. Based on the political context of that election, it appears that IRV could be a better fit for certain societies.\n\nThe new majority rule philosophy is an exciting development that could make IRV the go-to choice for future elections. The study highlights the importance of considering societal values and context when designing voting systems, and shows how a simple change in perspective can have a big impact.","title":"Revolutionary New Majority Rule Philosophy Makes Instant Runoff Voting Even More Popular","link":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08430","id":"2308.08430","slug":"revolutionary-new-majority-rule-philosophy-makes-instant-runoff-voting-even-more-popular","creator":"Ross Hyman, Deb Otis, Seamus Allen, Greg Dennis","topic":"economics"}
