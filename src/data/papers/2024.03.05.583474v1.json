{"title":"Silencing Forest Diseases: Scientists Pioneer New Technique to Combat Pine Pitch Canker","summary":"Scientists have successfully used Spray-Induced Gene Silencing (SIGS) to combat the devastating forest disease Pine Pitch Canker, which is caused by Fusarium circinatum.","intro":"In a breakthrough for forest health, researchers have developed an innovative new technique that could help protect pine trees from deadly diseases. The team has shown that Spray-Induced Gene Silencing (SIGS) can be used to combat Pine Pitch Canker, a disease caused by the fungal pathogen Fusarium circinatum.","text":"Pine Pitch Canker is a major problem for forest ecosystems around the world. It causes significant damage to pine trees, leading to reduced growth and even death. Currently, there are few effective treatments available for this disease, making it a major threat to forest health.\n\nNow, scientists have developed a new technique that could help combat Pine Pitch Canker and other devastating forest diseases. The approach, known as Spray-Induced Gene Silencing (SIGS), involves the external application of specific double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) molecules, which can modulate the expression of target genes through environmental RNA interference in eukaryotes.\n\nTo test the effectiveness of SIGS against Pine Pitch Canker, researchers designed and produced dsRNA molecules to target essential fungal genes involved in vesicle trafficking, signal transduction, and cell wall biogenesis metabolic pathways. They then applied these dsRNAs to Fusarium circinatum, the pathogen that causes Pine Pitch Canker.\n\nThe results were striking. The researchers found that F. circinatum was able to take up externally applied dsRNA, triggering an inhibition of the pathogen's virulence. Furthermore, they discovered that recurrent applications of dsRNAs in SIGS were more effective in protecting plants than single applications.\n\nThis is a major breakthrough for forest health. By using SIGS to combat Pine Pitch Canker and other devastating forest diseases, researchers can help protect pine trees and preserve the health of forest ecosystems around the world.","keywords":["SIGS","Pine Pitch Canker","Fusarium circinatum","forest disease","double-stranded RNA"],"prompt":"A spray bottle with a glowing green liquid, surrounded by healthy green pine trees","link":"http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2024.03.05.583474v1?rss=1","id":"2024.03.05.583474v1","slug":"silencing-forest-diseases-scientists-pioneer-new-technique-to-combat-pine-pitch-canker","creator":"Bocos Asenjo, I.
