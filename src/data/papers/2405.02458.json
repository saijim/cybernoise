  "text": "Imagine being able to access vast amounts of data while keeping sensitive information completely confidential. Sounds like science fiction, right? Well, thanks to the innovative minds behind Controlled Query Evaluation (CQE), this is now a reality! CQE is a form of query answering that ensures confidentiality when dealing with massive databases and ontologies. But what makes this breakthrough so remarkable? The answer lies in epistemic dependencies – a game-changing approach to expressing data protection policies. By harnessing the power of epistemic dependencies, researchers have created a policy language that goes beyond anything seen before in CQE. This means that data protection rules can now be tailored to meet the most specific and complex needs of organizations and individuals alike. But what does this mean in practical terms? Essentially, it allows for the creation of ultra-secure query answering systems that can safeguard sensitive information like never before. So, how did scientists achieve this remarkable feat? By developing a framework that enables the expression of rich and nuanced data protection rules through epistemic dependencies. This framework has been put to the test using Description Logic DL-Lite_R – a type of ontology language used in databases. The results are nothing short of astonishing! While the problem of CQE is generally considered intractable, researchers have proven that it can be made tractable by using acyclic epistemic dependencies. But what does this mean for the future? It paves the way for the practical implementation and application of this revolutionary approach to CQE. Imagine a world where sensitive information is protected with unparalleled security – a world where data privacy is paramount. This breakthrough brings us one step closer to making that vision a reality. With the potential to transform the way we handle confidential data, Controlled Query Evaluation through epistemic dependencies is an innovation that will change the face of data protection forever!",
