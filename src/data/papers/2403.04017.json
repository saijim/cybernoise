  "intro": "Get ready for a mind-blowing fusion of AI and automated reasoning! Machine learning is set to transform the way we approach theorem proving and problem solving. By guiding automated theorem provers and formal proof assistants, machine learning can help overcome large combinatorial explosion and increase performance.",
  "text": "Automated theorem provers and formal proof assistants are incredible tools that, in theory, can prove any theorem and solve any problem reducible to mathematics and logical reasoning. However, these systems often face massive combinatorial explosion, leading to the inclusion of numerous heuristics and choice points that significantly impact their performance.\n\nThis is where machine learning comes in! Trained predictors can guide the work of such reasoning systems, making them even more powerful and efficient. On the flip side, deductive search supported by the notion of logically valid proof enables machine learning systems to learn from large reasoning corpora.\n\nThese proof corpora are usually correct by construction and, when combined with increasingly precise trained guidance, can be boostrapped into vast repositories filled with longer reasoning chains and potentially novel proof ideas. This symbiotic relationship between AI and automated reasoning has the potential to create a powerful feedback loop that benefits both fields.\n\nIn this paper, we'll explore several automated reasoning and theorem proving domains and the learning and AI methods that have been developed for them. From premise selection to proof guidance, symbolic classification problems, and beyond, the future of reasoning is here, and it's powered by machine learning!",
