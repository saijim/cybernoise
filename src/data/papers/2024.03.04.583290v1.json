A groundbreaking new tool, called HIVE, now makes it possible to unravel the complex interplay between plant responses to multiple stressors. By integrating unpaired multi-omics datasets from seven experiments on peanut wild relatives during root-knot nematode infection and drought stress, HIVE identified promising candidates responsible for triggering effective defense.","text":"Plants are constantly exposed to a variety of environmental factors that can be either beneficial or detrimental. They have developed high phenotypic plasticity, allowing them to rapidly respond to these changing conditions through intricate signaling pathways. When multiple stresses occur simultaneously, plants must prioritize their response by activating appropriate signaling pathways. However, most studies focus on individual stress factors, with few exceptions examining the combined effects of multiple stressors.\n\nCurrent methods for integrating unpaired experiments involve performing meta-analyses or identifying differentially expressed genes in each condition and then selecting common ones. While these approaches have provided valuable insights, they are limited in their ability to identify non-specific conserved mechanisms that may hold broader implications for plant defense response mechanisms.\n\nTo address this limitation, researchers developed HIVE (Horizontal Integration analysis using Variational AutoEncoders), a tool designed to analyze horizontally integrated multi-omics datasets composed of unpaired and/or longitudinal experiments. By combining variational autoencoders with random forest regression and the SHAP explainer, HIVE selects relevant genes associated with the studied phenotype in the latent space.\n\nThe researchers demonstrated HIVE's functionality by analyzing transcriptional changes in two peanut wild relatives during root-knot nematode Meloidogyne arenaria infection and/or drought stress from seven unpaired experiments. Compared to meta-analysis and state-of-the-art tools, HIVE performed better and identified novel defense candidates.\n\nThese findings have significant implications for developing resilient crops capable of withstanding multiple stressors. By identifying the genetic basis of plant responses to biotic and abiotic stress, researchers can develop targeted strategies for improving crop yield and productivity in changing environments.\n\nIn summary, HIVE is a powerful new tool that offers unprecedented insights into plant defense mechanisms by analyzing horizontally integrated multi-omics datasets from unpaired experiments. Its ability to identify non-specific conserved mechanisms may hold the key to developing more resilient crops in a rapidly changing world.","keywords":["HIVE","multi-omics integration","plant defense response","biotic stress","abiotic stress"],"prompt":{"description":"An illustration of HIVE, a multi-omics integration tool, analyzing unpaired experiments on peanut wild relatives during root-knot nematode infection and drought stress.","generative_AI_prompt":"A futuristic laboratory setting with a computer screen displaying the HIVE analysis of multiple omics datasets from unpaired experiments on peanut wild relatives during biotic (root-knot nematode) and abiotic (drought) stress."},"link":"http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2024.03.04.583290v1?rss=1","id":"2024.03.04.583290v1","slug":"unlocking-plant-defense-mechanisms-with-hive-a-revolutionary-multi-omics-integration-tool","creator":"Calia, G., Zotta Mota, A.
