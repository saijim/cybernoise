This framework is highly relevant for applied research, but its implementation can be difficult due to the regression function becoming the solution to a nonlinear integral equation. \n\nNow, scientists have developed a simple iterative procedure to estimate such models, making it easier than ever before to tackle this complex problem. The study's authors demonstrate some of the asymptotic properties of this method and provide guidance on its implementation in cases where the instrumental variable is binary.\n\nIn a simulation experiment, researchers explore the intricacies of implementing this new technique. They conclude with an empirical application that examines the effect of pollution on house prices using a short panel of U.S. counties. This innovative study offers a promising path forward for researchers seeking to estimate nonparametric regressions with continuous endogenous variables and discrete instruments.","title":"Revolutionary Iterative Procedure Simplifies Nonparametric Regression Estimation for Continuous Endogenous Variables and Discrete Instruments","link":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.07812","id":"1905.07812","slug":"revolutionary-iterative-procedure-simplifies-nonparametric-regression-estimation-for-continuous-endogenous-variables-and-discrete-instruments","creator":"Samuele Centorrino, Fr\\'ed\\'erique F\\`eve, Jean-Pierre Florens","topic":"economics"}
