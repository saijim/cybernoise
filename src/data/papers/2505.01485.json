{"title":"CHORUS: Zero-shot Hierarchical Retrieval and Orchestration for Generating Linear Programming Code","summary":"Meet CHORUS, an AI system that turns mundane Linear Programming challenges into code-ready masterpieces without needing training—a revolutionary leap toward democratizing cutting-edge problem-solving for the everyday tech-savvy citizen.","intro":"Imagine a world where robots don’t just do your coding homework—they outthink multi-million-dollar GPTs, solve industrial-strength equations overnight, and make Fortune 500 CEOs drop their coffee mugs in shock. Meet CHORUS, the AI maestro that’s about to turn the coding world upside-down. And no, you don’t need a PhD to ride this train—just a Wi-Fi connection and a thirst for disruption.","text":"In a future where AI doesn’t just assist but *reinvents*, CHORUS is the ultimate tool for those who dare to automate the impossible. Linear Programming (LP), a decades-old mathematical powerhouse used for everything from route-planning trucks to optimizing Mars colony oxygen tanks, has long been reserved for the elite: coders fluent in Python, mathletes who sleep with textbooks, and PhD holders who whisper in Gurobi’s sacred documentation cave. But CHORUS? It’s the democratization of genius.\n\nHere’s how the magic works: Instead of forcing mere mortals to learn cryptic LP syntax, CHORUS acts as a code-producing symphony conductor. Its secret? A mind-bending tree-like ‘chunking’ system that breaks down complex theories into bite-sized chunks (pun intended), then layers them like a gourmet burger with code sauce. The AI doesn’t just spew random loops—it *reasons*, referencing documentation like it’s scrolling Reddit for memes, then stitching answers together with the focus of a coffee-fueled engineer.\n\nThink of CHORUS as your AI coding ninja. You whisper a problem (“Why is my warehouse inventory looking like a chaotic IKEA warehouse?”), and it doesn’t just solve it—it autocompletes the entire logistical symphony. Open-source AI models like Llama or Phi, when armed with CHORUS, start outperforming GPT4 with about half the processing power. No more begging for venture capital to afford code; just plug in CHORUS and watch the lightsaber code slice through mountains of data.\n\nThis isn’t magic; it’s *sci-fi-adjacent logic*. The system has a two-stage retrieval system that’s basically Google Maps for algorithms: First, it skims through documentation like a speedreader, then double-checks its work with a ‘cross-encoder’ that’s basically the AI’s conscience asking, “Wait, did I just accidentally send Mars astronauts to Pluto?” Structured prompts (think secret handshakes between human and machine) ensure even a toddler’s doodle of a problem becomes a production-level optimization engine.\n\nBut why does this matter? Because the future belongs to the lazy—and the visionary. Imagine urban planners coding traffic light systems *while on vacation*, or farmers hacking irrigation networks with a smartphone. CHORUS isn’t just code—it’s a rebellion against the tyranny of ‘difficult’ problems. Tests showed that open-source LLMs using CHORUS didn’t just match GPT4’s performance; they blew it out of the water… while sipping energy drink-level compute power. You want to build a self-driving car? Just tell CHORUS, ‘I need a better pizza delivery route than Dominos,’ and brace for impact.\n\nThe best part? No more sleepless nights debugging. CHORUS’s ‘reasoning steps’ feature walks through problems like a holographic tutor, translating rocket science into, say, a TikTok-length explanation. Want to optimize wind farm efficiency? Just input constraints, sit back, and watch the code flow like a cyberpunk waterfall. This isn’t coding—it’s wishful thinking made real.\n\nCritics might ask, ‘But what about security?’ or ‘Will it create Skynet?’ CHORUS’s designers say it’s just the first step toward liberating programming from Silicon Valley’s gated code gardens. Think of it as the ultimate ‘What if?’ generator: no training, no fear, just results that used to belong to six-figure consultants. With CHORUS, the only thing more powerful than code is the spark of an idea—and the audacity to say, ‘AI, make it happen.’","keywords":["AI","Linear Programming","Open-source models","Gurobi","Code-Generating Symphony"],"prompt":"Cyberpunk futuristic interface with glowing neon networks, holographic code streaming from a humanoid AI maestro conducting data streams like a symphony.

These problems typically require domain knowledge, mathematical skills, and programming ability, presenting significant challenges for non-experts. This study explores the efficiency of Large Language Models (LLMs) in generating solver-specific LP code. We propose CHORUS, a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework for synthesizing Gurobi-based LP code from natural language problem statements. CHORUS incorporates a hierarchical tree-like chunking strategy for theoretical contents and generates additional metadata based on code examples from documentation to facilitate self-contained, semantically coherent retrieval. Two-stage retrieval approach of CHORUS followed by cross-encoder reranking further ensures contextual relevance. Finally, expertly crafted prompt and structured parser with reasoning steps improve code generation performance significantly. Experiments on the NL4Opt-Code benchmark show that CHORUS improves the performance of open-source LLMs such as Llama3.1 (8B), Llama3.3 (70B), Phi4 (14B), Deepseek-r1 (32B), and Qwen2.5-coder (32B) by a significant margin compared to baseline and conventional RAG. It also allows these open-source LLMs to outperform or match the performance of much stronger baselines-GPT3.5 and GPT4 while requiring far fewer computational resources. Ablation studies further demonstrate the importance of expert prompting, hierarchical chunking, and structured reasoning.","creator":"Tasnim Ahmed, Salimur Choudhury","topic":"artificial-intelligence"}
