The study, published in arXiv, explores the 'Dictator's Dilemma', a phenomenon where dictators are presented with distorted information and struggle to make informed decisions.\n\nThe researchers created a model based on three fundamental premises: a) dictators govern based on information from advisors, b) deception from advisors cannot decrease over time, and c) deception is affected by the country's encountered difficulties. The model demonstrates effective control in the short term but becomes unstable over time, leading to the gradual deterioration of the country's state.\n\nThe study also found that as a dictator loses control, advisors' deception increases, while the dictator believes the government is doing a reasonable job. The researchers validated their model by analyzing historical data of grain production in the Soviet Union from 1928 to 1940.\n\nThe findings have significant implications for understanding how information distortion affects governance and decision-making in autocratic regimes. By developing this quantitative theory, researchers provide valuable insights into the complex dynamics of dictatorships and their impact on society.","title":"Revolutionary Quantitative Theory Explains Information Distortion in Autocratic Regimes","link":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01666","id":"2310.01666","slug":"revolutionary-quantitative-theory-explains-information-distortion-in-autocratic-regimes","creator":"Vakhtang Putkaradze","topic":"economics"}
