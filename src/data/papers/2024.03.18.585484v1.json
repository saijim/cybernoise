The CMV 2b protein is a crucial element in the virus's arsenal, enabling it to suppress plant defenses and act as a pathogenicity determinant.\n\nThe study reveals that the 2b protein binds to AGO1, inhibiting its function. However, if this inhibition becomes too efficient, Arabidopsis thaliana plants respond by reinforcing antiviral silencing through AGO2 and increasing resistance against aphids, which are the insect vectors of CMV. To prevent excessive inhibition of AGO1, the CMV 1a protein sequesters sufficient 2b protein molecules into P-bodies.\n\nTo better understand these interactions, researchers generated mutant 2b protein variants and used red and green fluorescent protein fusions to study subcellular colocalization with AGO1 and the 1a protein. Bimolecular fluorescence complementation and co-immunoprecipitation assays were also performed to analyze the effects of mutations on complex formation with the 1a protein and AGO1.\n\nThough residues 56-60 influenced the interactions of the 2b protein with the 1a protein and AGO1, it appears unlikely that any single residue or sequence domain is solely responsible. Intrinsic disorder within the 2b protein secondary structure was predicted by circular dichroism (CD), but not nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy.\n\nIntrinsic disorder provides a plausible model to explain the ability of the 2b protein to interact with AGO1, the 1a protein, and other factors. However, resolving conflicting conclusions between CD and NMR is necessary before proceeding further. These exciting findings open up new avenues for developing innovative strategies to combat this harmful plant pathogen.","title":"Decoding the Cucumber Mosaic Virus's Sneaky Protein: A Giant Leap Towards Plant Defense Strategies","link":"http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2024.03.18.585484v1?rss=1","id":"2024.03.18.585484v1","slug":"decoding-the-cucumber-mosaic-virus-s-sneaky-protein-a-giant-leap-towards-plant-defense-strategies","creator":"Crawshaw, S., Murphy, A.
