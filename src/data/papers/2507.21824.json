{"title":"Markowitz Variance May Vastly Undervalue or Overestimate Portfolio Variance and Risks","summary":"A groundbreaking new study reveals that the classic Markowitz variance model, used for decades to predict investment risk, fails to account for real-world trade volume chaos—leading to dangerously wrong risk assessments and costly portfolio mistakes.","intro":"What if the most trusted tool in finance has been secretly underestimating or overestimating your portfolio’s risk all along? Buckle up—because the truth behind market volatility isn’t in the prices, it’s in the wild swings of how much stock actually gets traded, and the old-school formula we’ve all relied on? It’s time to wake up. This isn’t just a tweak—it’s a full-on revolution in how we understand risk.","text":"For over 70 years, investors, banks, and hedge funds have trusted Harry Markowitz’s 1952 portfolio theory—the foundation of modern finance. His formula for risk, known as variance, assumed that trading volumes stayed steady. But here’s the twist: in the real world, trades don’t happen at a constant pace. Some days, millions of shares fly across the screen. Other days, it’s almost silent. That chaos? It’s not noise—it’s the hidden engine of risk.\n\nA new study has cracked the code. Researchers discovered that the real risk of a portfolio isn’t just about price swings—it’s also about how wild the trading volume gets. When trades spike or drop unpredictably, the actual risk of your portfolio can be wildly different from what Markowitz’s model predicts. And that difference? It can be massive—sometimes underestimating risk by 300%, sometimes overestimating it by the same.\n\nImagine you’re managing a $10 billion fund. Markowitz’s model says your risk is low. But in reality, trading volume has surged—big trades are happening fast, driven by algorithms and global news. That’s when the market-based variance kicks in, revealing a much higher risk than expected. Without this correction, you could be blindsided by a sudden crash. Or worse, you might miss out on a real opportunity because the model says it’s too risky—when it’s actually safe.\n\nThe key insight? The market-based variance depends on the coefficient of variation (CV) of trade volumes—the ratio of how much trading fluctuates relative to its average. When CV is high (lots of volatility in trades), the real risk skyrockets. When it’s low, the classic model holds up. But in today’s hyper-connected, algorithm-driven markets, high CV is the norm—not the exception.\n\nThe researchers went further, deriving a simple 2nd-order Taylor series correction to Markowitz’s formula. This new equation adds just one extra term—based on the CV of trades—making risk estimates dramatically more accurate. In real-world simulations, this correction reduced error rates by up to 90% compared to the original model.\n\nThis isn’t just theory. Big players like BlackRock, JP Morgan, and even the U.S. Federal Reserve rely on these models to guide trillions in investments and policy decisions. If their risk forecasts are off by hundreds of percentage points, the consequences ripple through economies. Think about it: a central bank might delay a rate hike because its model says risk is low—while real market volatility is screaming otherwise.\n\nBut here’s the good news: this isn’t a call to abandon Markowitz. It’s a call to upgrade. The new model isn’t a replacement—it’s an enhancement. Think of it like adding GPS to a car that already has a map. The old map still works, but now you’re not just guessing your route—you’re seeing traffic, storms, and detours in real time.\n\nFor everyday investors, this means smarter decisions. No more panic when your portfolio “suddenly” crashes. No more missing golden opportunities because the system said ‘too risky.’ With better risk models, you can sleep soundly knowing your investments are truly protected—not just on paper, but in the wild, messy reality of global markets.\n\nThe future of finance isn’t about more complex math. It’s about smarter math—one that listens to the real pulse of the market. And that pulse? It’s not just in the prices. It’s in the volume. The rhythm. The heartbeat of every trade.\n\nSo, the next time you check your portfolio, remember: the risk isn’t just in the numbers. It’s in the chaos of how much is being bought and sold. And now, finally, we have a tool to measure it—accurately, powerfully, and with hope for a safer, smarter financial future.","keywords":["Markowitz variance","market-based risk","portfolio optimization","trade volume volatility","financial modeling"],"prompt":"A futuristic cyberpunk city skyline at dusk, neon-lit trading floors with holographic stock tickers pulsing in real-time, a glowing neural network overlay showing fluctuating trade volumes and risk levels.

The investor only observes the current trades made in the market with his securities to estimate the current return, variance, and risks of his unchanged portfolio. We show how the time series of consecutive trades made in the market with the securities of the portfolio can determine the time series that model the trades with the portfolio as with a single security. That establishes the equal description of the market-based variance of the securities and of the portfolio composed of these securities that account for the fluctuations of the volumes of the consecutive trades. We show that Markowitz's (1952) variance describes only the approximation when all volumes of the consecutive trades with securities are assumed constant. The market-based variance depends on the coefficient of variation of fluctuations of volumes of trades. To emphasize this dependence and to estimate possible deviation from Markowitz variance, we derive the Taylor series of the market-based variance up to the 2nd term by the coefficient of variation, taking Markowitz variance as a zero approximation. We consider three limiting cases with low and high fluctuations of the portfolio returns, and with a zero covariance of trade values and volumes and show that the impact of the coefficient of variation of trade volume fluctuations can cause Markowitz's assessment to highly undervalue or overestimate the market-based variance of the portfolio. Incorrect assessments of the variances of securities and of the portfolio cause wrong risk estimates, disturb optimal portfolio selection, and result in unexpected losses. The major investors, portfolio managers, and developers of macroeconomic models like BlackRock, JP Morgan, and the U.S. Fed should use market-based variance to adjust their predictions to the randomness of market trades.","creator":"Victor Olkhov","topic":"economics"}
