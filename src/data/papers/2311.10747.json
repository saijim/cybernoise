{"title":"Revolutionary Breakthrough in Autonomous Driving: Safe and Efficient Reinforcement Learning with FUSION","summary":"Unlock the full potential of autonomous driving with our groundbreaking FUSION method! Leveraging structured scenario information, we ensure safety and efficiency in varying traffic contexts, outperforming existing baselines.","intro":"Imagine a future where self-driving cars navigate through bustling cities with unparalleled safety and efficiency - welcome to the world of FUSION, the game-changing technology that's about to revolutionize autonomous driving forever!","text":"In this paper, we introduce FUSION, a pioneering methodology that enables safe and efficient reinforcement learning in autonomous driving by leveraging structured scenario information. Our approach capitalizes on the causal relationships between decomposed reward, cost, state, and action space, allowing for structured sequential reasoning under dynamic traffic environments. We demonstrate the superiority of FUSION over contemporary baselines in two real-world settings, showcasing its ability to balance safety costs and utility rewards. With FUSION, we can finally achieve the long-awaited goal of safe and efficient autonomous driving - join us in shaping the future of transportation!","keywords":["autonomous driving","reinforcement learning","safety-aware","causal representation"],"prompt":"a futuristic cityscape with self-driving cars navigating through busy streets, with a glowing blue light representing the FUSION technology.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10747","id":"2311.10747","slug":"revolutionary-breakthrough-in-autonomous-driving-safe-and-efficient-reinforcement-learning-with-fusion","creator":"Haohong Lin, Wenhao Ding, Zuxin Liu, Yaru Niu, Jiacheng Zhu, Yuming Niu, Ding Zhao","topic":"artificial-intelligence"}
