A comparison of human annotators against the AI model, ODYSSEE","summary":"A new AI model, ODYSSEE, is revolutionizing oyster reef monitoring, but can it outperform human annotators?","intro":"Imagine a world where conservationists can monitor oyster reefs without disrupting the delicate ecosystem - thanks to AI, that world is now within reach. But is the technology ready for prime time?","text":"Oyster reefs are some of the most vital ecosystems on the planet, providing a habitat for countless species and protecting coastlines from erosion. However, monitoring these reefs is a labor-intensive process that often requires destructive sampling methods. That's where ODYSSEE, a cutting-edge AI model, comes in. Developed using deep learning techniques, ODYSSEE can identify live oysters in images and videos taken in the field, making it a potentially game-changing tool for conservationists. But how does it stack up against human annotators? In a recent comparison, ODYSSEE was pitted against both expert and non-expert annotators to see how accurately it could identify live oysters on a reef. The results were mixed - while ODYSSEE was significantly faster than its human counterparts, making inferences in a matter of seconds compared to hours, it also overpredicted the number of live oysters, achieving an accuracy of just 63%. In contrast, expert annotators achieved an accuracy of 74%, while non-experts came close with 75%. So, what went wrong? Image quality turned out to be a major factor, with better quality images actually worsening the model's accuracy while improving human performance. Despite these limitations, the future looks bright for ODYSSEE. With further training on higher-quality images and additional annotation training classes, it's likely that the model's predictive power will improve dramatically. As the technology continues to evolve, we can expect to see more efficient and effective conservation efforts. Imagine being able to monitor oyster reefs in real-time, without disrupting the ecosystem - it's a prospect that's both exciting and tantalizingly within reach. As researchers continue to refine ODYSSEE and other AI models, we're on the cusp of a revolution in conservation technology. With its potential to transform the way we monitor and manage ecosystems, AI is set to play a starring role in the quest to protect our planet's precious biodiversity.","keywords":["AI","Conservation","Oyster Reefs","Deep Learning","Ecosystem Monitoring"],"prompt":"Generate an image of a futuristic underwater scene, with a swarm of drones monitoring an oyster reef, in the style of Syd Mead and Simon Stalenhag, with a mix of neon lights and dark, muted colors, incorporating elements of cyberpunk and marine biology.","id":"2505.03108","slug":"reef-revolution-ai-takes-the-lead-in-oyster-conservation","link":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03108","abstract":"Abstract: Oysters are ecologically and commercially important species that require frequent monitoring to track population demographics (e.g. abundance, growth, mortality). Current methods of monitoring oyster reefs often require destructive sampling methods and extensive manual effort. Therefore, they are suboptimal for small-scale or sensitive environments. A recent alternative, the ODYSSEE model, was developed to use deep learning techniques to identify live oysters using video or images taken in the field of oyster reefs to assess abundance. The validity of this model in identifying live oysters on a reef was compared to expert and non-expert annotators. In addition, we identified potential sources of prediction error. Although the model can make inferences significantly faster than expert and non-expert annotators (39.6 s, $2.34 \\pm 0.61$ h, $4.50 \\pm 1.46$ h, respectively), the model overpredicted the number of live oysters, achieving lower accuracy (63\\%) in identifying live oysters compared to experts (74\\%) and non-experts (75\\%) alike. Image quality was an important factor in determining the accuracy of the model and the annotators. Better quality images improved human accuracy and worsened model accuracy. Although ODYSSEE was not sufficiently accurate, we anticipate that future training on higher-quality images, utilizing additional live imagery, and incorporating additional annotation training classes will greatly improve the model's predictive power based on the results of this analysis. Future research should address methods that improve the detection of living vs. dead oysters.","creator":"Brendan Campbell, Alan Williams, Kleio Baxevani, Alyssa Campbell, Rushabh Dhoke, Rileigh E.
