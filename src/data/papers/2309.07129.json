Discover the groundbreaking role of Ontologies in ensuring garden-like growth of data's findability, accessibility, interoperability and reusability!","text":"The digital revolution is now moving at an accelerated pace, but what if we told you that even the plant science field is catching up with it? Enter the world of 'Ontologies', our new wizards ready to revolutionize the future of plant-related data handling.\n\nTo navigate the thick foliage of complex datasets generated by modern 'omics technologies', you need a machete; or in the language of our tech-savvy gardeners, you need 'Ontologies'. These wizard-like coding systems tag and sort data semantically, creating logical connections that enhance the understanding of how data was born and its lifecycle.\n\nAs plant kingdoms, both exotic and common, share a myriad of secrets that could redefine our world, the need to make essential plant research data FAIR- findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable, is critical. The utilization of Ontologies transforms data into a format that is easily readable by machines and humans alike. It's like being given the Rosetta Stone to the encrypted language of plant data.\n\nHowever, spotting the right Ontologies pertinent to a particular domain or technology within the sundry realm of plant science is a tricky task. Worry not, as we peel back the layers of the onion to reveal the most relevant Ontologies for the core plant sciences. Our trusty ISA (Investigation-Study-Assay) metadata framework can annotate data concerning plant-specific experiments to make the transition to FAIR-ness seamless.\n\nMoreover, stress no more about sifting through the forest of Ontologies, as the golden pathway to appropriate scholarly repositories and platforms has been paved for you. With these platforms, identifying Ancillary Ontologies or specific ontology terms has never been easier.  \n\nOverall, the application of Ontologies in plant science is a thrilling narrative of futuristic, boundary-pushing research that trades in the dreariness of data handling for a rejuvenating wave of reusability and interoperability. This truly is turning over a new leaf for the scientific community, where the verdant future of data handling within plant sciences is not only FAIR but flourishing.","keywords":["Ontologies","FAIR data","Plant Sciences","Data Interoperability","Data Reusability"],"prompt":"A futuristic computer interface with flowing green lines of code showcasing layers of interconnected, plant-shaped elements, symbolizing Ontologies in plant research","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07129","id":"2309.07129","slug":"hacking-the-green-matrix-revolutionizing-plant-data-reusability","creator":"Kathryn Dumschott, Hannah D&#xf6;rpholz, Marie-Ang&#xe9;lique Laporte, Dominik Brilhaus, Andrea Schrader, Bj&#xf6;rn Usadel, Steffen Neumann, Elizabeth Arnaud, Angela Kranz","topic":"artificial-intelligence"}
