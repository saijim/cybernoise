Introducing ERASER, the groundbreaking framework that revolutionizes machine unlearning in MLaaS (Machine Learning-as-a-Service) with an innovative inference serving-aware approach. Say goodbye to security vulnerabilities and hello to seamless privacy protection!","text":"In this paper, we present ERASER, a novel framework for machinE unleaRning in MLaAS via an inferencE seRving-aware approach. Our proposed certified inference consistency mechanism reduces inference latency by selectively postponing unlearning execution, ensuring strict adherence to the 'right to be forgotten' principle. With three tailor-made variants, ERASER offers unparalleled flexibility and adaptability to diverse MLaaS systems. Experiments in various settings demonstrate ERASER's effectiveness, achieving up to 99% inference latency savings and 31% computation overhead reduction compared to the inference-oblivion baseline.","keywords":["MLaaS","machine unlearning","inference serving","right to be forgotten","privacy protection"],"prompt":"Imagine a world where your personal data is protected with cutting-edge technology. Envision a future where you have complete control over your digital footprint. That future starts now with ERASER - the ultimate solution for secure and private MLaaS experiences.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16136","id":"2311.16136","slug":"eraser-revolutionizing-machine-unlearning-in-mlaas-with-inference-serving-aware-approach","creator":"Yuke Hu, Jian Lou, Jiaqi Liu, Feng Lin, Zhan Qin, Kui Ren","topic":"artificial-intelligence"}
