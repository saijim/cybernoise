The collaborative effort, which consolidated databases from all 13 major French wine areas, aimed to evaluate foliar symptoms associated with esca and Eutypa dieback in 36 different cultivars.\n\nThe research, published in a renowned scientific journal, explored the prevalence (number of plots with at least one symptomatic plant) and incidence (percentage of symptomatic plants) of esca and Eutypa dieback using quantitative analysis. The large-scale dataset, comprising records from 2082 plots and 36 cultivars, unveiled crucial insights into the effects of cultivar, year, and plot age on both prevalence and incidence of esca leaf symptoms.\n\nAccording to the study, esca was present in an average of 74 +/- 2% plots annually, with a steady incidence rate of 3.1 +/- 0.1%. Eutypa dieback, on the other hand, affected approximately 41 +/- 3% of the plots, exhibiting an average incidence of 1.4 +/- 0.1%.\n\nUtilizing temporal Bayesian modelling, researchers examined cultivar impact on prevalence and incidence rates of esca leaf symptoms.\n\nThe results demonstrated that while the cultivar significantly influenced the prevalence of esca, its impact on incidence was not significant when disease prevalence surpassed zero. Furthermore, esca prevalence remained relatively stable, but its incidence increased in six out of ten years following 2012.\n\nInterestingly, a notable non-linear effect of plot age was discovered as well.\n10- to 30-year-old plots were found to be significantly more susceptible to esca and Eutypa dieback depending on the cultivar.\n\nIn conclusion, this cutting-edge research emphasizes the value of extensive and continuous monitoring in grapevine disease management.\nThe findings provide essential insights for industry professionals and researchers working towards improving crop health and reducing the impact of devastating diseases like esca and Eutypa dieback.","title":"Revolutionary Study Uncovers Impact of Cultivar, Year, and Plot Age on Grapevine Trunk Diseases in France's Wine Regions","link":"http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2024.03.19.585220v1?rss=1","id":"2024.03.19.585220v1","slug":"revolutionary-study-uncovers-impact-of-cultivar-year-and-plot-age-on-grapevine-trunk-diseases-in-france-s-wine-regions","creator":"Etienne, L., Fabre, F., Martinetti, D., Frank, E., Michel, L., Bonnardot, V., Guerin Dubrana, L., Delmas, C.
