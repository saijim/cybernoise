Sounds like science fiction, right? But with SORA, the innovative text-to-video (T2V) model, this is now a reality. However, despite its numerous benefits, there's still one crucial question that remains unanswered: what drives users to adopt this technology in the first place? In a groundbreaking study, researchers set out to investigate the factors that influence user willingness to use SORA, and their findings are nothing short of remarkable. By extending the extended unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT2) with perceived realism and novelty value, the study reveals that these two factors play a crucial role in determining whether users will jump on board the SORA bandwagon or not. But what exactly do we mean by perceived realism and novelty value? Simply put, perceived realism refers to how realistic and lifelike the videos generated by SORA appear to be, while novelty value is all about how new and exciting this technology seems to users. Using a combination of advanced statistical techniques, including covariance-based structural equation modeling and fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA), the researchers analyzed data from 940 respondents in the US and found that both perceived realism and novelty value have a significant impact on user willingness to use SORA. But here's the really interesting part: it turns out that perceived realism is the most influential driver of all, followed closely by novelty value. This means that if developers and marketers want to promote widespread adoption of T2V models like SORA, they need to focus on creating videos that are not only visually stunning but also feel incredibly realistic and immersive. Furthermore, the study identifies five key configurations that lead to high and low willingness to use SORA, providing valuable insights for anyone looking to get ahead in this rapidly evolving field. So what does the future hold for SORA and T2V models like it? With its high predictive validity and contribution to theory advancement, this study is set to revolutionize the way we think about visual content creation - and we can't wait to see what's next!","title":"The Secret to Making Users Fall in Love with SORA: Unlocking the Power of Text-to-Video Models","link":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03986","id":"2405.03986","slug":"the-secret-to-making-users-fall-in-love-with-sora-unlocking-the-power-of-text-to-video-models","creator":"Gustave Florentin Nkoulou Mvondo, Ben Niu","topic":"artificial-intelligence"}
