  "intro": "In the era of big data, AI-driven text mining has emerged as a game-changer for the biomedical field. By automating the analysis of vast textual resources, researchers can now make breakthroughs more efficiently than ever before. Curious about the impact of these cutting-edge advancements? Join us as we delve into the exciting world of AI-powered text mining and explore its transformative role in biomedicine.",
  "text": "The booming field of biomedical research generates a massive volume of textual data daily, including scientific literature, electronic health records, clinical trial reports, and social media posts. Manually sifting through these resources is time-consuming and inefficient, leading to an urgent need for automated solutions.\n\nEnter AI-driven text mining: a powerful approach that combines natural language processing with machine learning algorithms. This technology enables computers to understand, interpret, and extract meaningful insights from complex textual data, revolutionizing the way researchers analyze biomedical information.\n\nCommunity challenges have played an essential role in driving innovation and collaboration in the field of AI-powered biomedical text mining. These competitions offer platforms for researchers to develop state-of-the-art solutions for data mining and knowledge processing tasks. They also foster interdisciplinary collaborations among experts from various domains, including computer science, information technology, medicine, and healthcare.\n\nIn this article, we'll review the recent advances in community challenges specific to Chinese biomedical text mining. Our analysis includes named entity recognition, attribute extraction, relation extraction, event extraction, text classification, knowledge graph construction, question answering, and large language model evaluation.\n\nThese AI-powered applications showcase immense potential for real-world clinical use. For example, improved text generation capabilities can help doctors create more accurate patient records, while better question answering systems can assist patients in understanding their diagnoses and treatment options. The integration of large language models with biomedical data promises to unlock new insights and accelerate scientific discovery.\n\nWhile these community challenges have significantly advanced the field, they do have limitations. Researchers must address issues such as inconsistent annotations, limited training datasets, and a lack of standardized evaluation metrics. To overcome these challenges, future research should focus on developing robust, high-quality datasets and refining evaluation methodologies.\n\nIn conclusion, AI-powered text mining is transforming biomedical research, providing researchers with faster, more accurate ways to analyze complex data. Community challenges continue to play a vital role in driving innovation and collaboration, paving the way for exciting breakthroughs and applications in the era of large language models.",
