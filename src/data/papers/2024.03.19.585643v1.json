Through chemical TE mobilization and doubled haploid induction, researchers generated a line with 40 new ONSEN copies. The study found that maternally expressed genes (MEGs) were preferentially targeted for transposition, aligning with the colocalization of H2A.Z and H3K27me3 in MEGs - both previously identified as promoters of ONSEN insertions.\n\nAdditionally, chemically-induced DNA hypomethylation was found to lead to global transcriptional deregulation in the endosperm, resulting in the breakdown of MEG imprinting. This exciting discovery provides insights into the epigenetic and transcriptional consequences of chemically induced TE remobilization and underscores the need for cautious interpretation of the connection between TEs and genomic imprinting. With further research, this breakthrough could lead to a better understanding of the role of TEs in imprinting establishment and have far-reaching implications for the field of epigenetics.","title":"Revolutionizing Epigenetics: The Impact of Chemically Induced Transposon Mobilization on Genomic Imprinting in Arabidopsis thaliana","link":"http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2024.03.19.585643v1?rss=1","id":"2024.03.19.585643v1","slug":"revolutionizing-epigenetics-the-impact-of-chemically-induced-transposon-mobilization-on-genomic-imprinting-in-arabidopsis-thaliana","creator":"del Toro-de Leon, G., van Boven, J., Santos-Gonzalez, J., Jiao, W.-B., Schneeberger, K., KoÌˆhler, C.","topic":"plant-biology"}
