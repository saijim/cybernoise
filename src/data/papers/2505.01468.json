For years, the focus has been on creating more powerful models, but the energy consumption required to train these models has become a significant concern. This is where GREEN, a novel approach to model selection, comes in - a game-changing solution that makes it possible to find the perfect balance between performance and energy consumption. By leveraging a vast dataset called EcoTaskSet, which comprises training dynamics from over 1767 experiments across various AI domains and tasks, GREEN provides a guided recommendation of energy-efficient networks. This approach is a significant departure from current methods, which are often limited to specific architectures or tasks. With GREEN, the possibilities are endless, and the future of AI has never looked brighter. The implications are profound - from reducing the carbon footprint of AI model training to enabling the widespread adoption of sustainable AI solutions. As we move forward in this new era of eco-friendly AI, one thing is clear: the future is green, and it's powered by innovation. The GREEN approach is not just a solution for the environment; it's also a powerful tool for developers and researchers. By providing a simple and effective way to select the best model configuration based on user preferences, GREEN is poised to democratize access to sustainable AI solutions. Whether you're working on a computer vision project, a natural language processing task, or a recommendation system, GREEN has got you covered. The experimental results are impressive, demonstrating that GREEN can successfully identify energy-efficient configurations while ensuring competitive performance. This is a major breakthrough, and it's set to transform the way we approach AI model development. As we look to the future, it's clear that GREEN is just the beginning. The potential for innovation in the field of eco-friendly AI is vast, and the possibilities are endless. One thing is certain, however - the future of AI is green, and it's an exciting time to be a part of this revolution. With GREEN leading the way, we can expect to see a new wave of sustainable AI solutions that are not only powerful but also environmentally friendly. The era of eco-friendly AI has arrived, and it's here to stay. As we embark on this new journey, we can expect to see significant advancements in the field of AI, from more efficient models to new applications and use cases. The impact will be felt across industries, from healthcare to finance, and from education to transportation. The world is changing, and AI is at the forefront of this change. With GREEN, we're not just talking about a new approach to model selection - we're talking about a new era of sustainability and innovation. The future is bright, and it's powered by eco-friendly AI. In the years to come, we can expect to see a significant reduction in the environmental impact of AI model training, and a corresponding increase in the adoption of sustainable AI solutions. This is a win-win situation, where the environment benefits, and so does the industry. The era of eco-friendly AI is upon us, and it's an exciting time to be alive. With GREEN leading the way, we can expect to see a new wave of innovation that will transform the world. The possibilities are endless, and the future is green.","keywords":["Artificial Intelligence","Eco-Friendly","Sustainable AI","Model Selection","GREEN"],"prompt":"Generate an image of a futuristic cityscape with a green glow, in the style of Syd Mead and Blade Runner, with sleek skyscrapers and flying cars, and a massive screen displaying a GREEN logo, reminiscent of the works of Ash Thorp and Simon Stalenhag.","id":"2505.01468","slug":"revolutionizing-ai-the-ultimate-eco-friendly-model-search","link":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01468","abstract":"Abstract: The environmental impact of Artificial Intelligence (AI) is emerging as a significant global concern, particularly regarding model training. In this paper, we introduce GREEN (Guided Recommendations of Energy-Efficient Networks), a novel, inference-time approach for recommending Pareto-optimal AI model configurations that optimize validation performance and energy consumption across diverse AI domains and tasks. Our approach directly addresses the limitations of current eco-efficient neural architecture search methods, which are often restricted to specific architectures or tasks. Central to this work is EcoTaskSet, a dataset comprising training dynamics from over 1767 experiments across computer vision, natural language processing, and recommendation systems using both widely used and cutting-edge architectures. Leveraging this dataset and a prediction model, our approach demonstrates effectiveness in selecting the best model configuration based on user preferences. Experimental results show that our method successfully identifies energy-efficient configurations while ensuring competitive performance.","creator":"Filippo Betello, Antonio Purificato, Vittoria Vineis, Gabriele Tolomei, Fabrizio Silvestri","topic":"artificial-intelligence"}
