  "summary": "Artificial intelligence is transforming biology, enabling us to tackle complex questions like never before. By harnessing the power of machine learning, we can reveal hidden patterns and mechanisms in biological systems.",
  "intro": "Imagine a world where artificial intelligence (AI) helps us unravel the secrets of life! That's right - AI is revolutionizing biology by providing new ways to understand complex phenomena. Machine learning (ML), a key component of AI, has emerged as a powerful tool for identifying patterns in large and intricate data sets. This technological breakthrough has significant implications for the future of scientific research.",
  "text": "Recent applications of ML in biological sciences have led to remarkable discoveries, but they also raise important questions about scientific understanding. To address these concerns, researchers are drawing from an epistemological toolkit and applying modern philosophical theories of understanding to contextualize ML models. By examining two key application areas - protein structure prediction and single cell RNA-sequencing - we can explore how these features enable ML systems to advance scientific knowledge, guide future model development, and overcome obstacles for biological discovery.\n\nConceptions of scientific understanding as information compression, qualitative intelligibility, and dependency relation modelling offer a useful framework for interpreting ML-mediated understanding. Information compression refers to the ability to summarize complex data into simpler forms, allowing researchers to extract meaningful insights from massive datasets. Qualitative intelligibility involves providing explanations that are comprehensible and relevant to human understanding. Lastly, dependency relation modelling deals with identifying relationships between variables, uncovering hidden patterns in biological systems.\n\nIn protein structure prediction, ML models use sequence information and evolutionary relationships to predict 3D structures. This approach has improved our understanding of protein function and regulation, paving the way for novel therapeutic strategies. In single cell RNA-sequencing, ML models decipher gene expression patterns, revealing insights into cellular heterogeneity and development.\n\nDespite these successes, challenges remain in preventing ML from achieving its full potential in biological discovery. Addressing these hurdles will improve the prospects of AI methods for solving important problems and advancing scientific understanding of living systems.",
