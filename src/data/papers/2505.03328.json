Discover the surprising truth about exporting and how it can transform your company into a productivity powerhouse!","text":"In a world where businesses are constantly looking for ways to stay ahead of the curve, exporting has emerged as a game-changer. But, what's the secret to unlocking its true potential? According to groundbreaking research, the key lies in export intensity - the proportion of total revenues generated from exports. The study reveals that exporting can indeed boost productivity, but only when export intensity reaches a certain threshold - 60% of total revenues. At this level, businesses can expect to see small but significant productivity gains of around 0.1-0.6% per year. But, what's happening below this threshold? It turns out that economies of scale and capital adjustment offset each other, resulting in minimal productivity losses of about 0.01% per year. However, there's a silver lining - firms that export between 8-60% of their total revenues are more likely to file patents, with the propensity peaking at 40%. This suggests that exporting is linked to building absorptive capacity and driving innovation. So, what does this mean for your business? By understanding the relationship between export intensity and productivity, you can make informed decisions about your export strategy and unlock the hidden potential within your organization. Whether you're a seasoned exporter or just starting out, this research provides valuable insights into the world of international trade and the opportunities that await. As the global economy continues to evolve, one thing is clear - exporting is no longer just about selling products abroad; it's about driving growth, innovation, and success.

After positing that export intensity acts as a continuous treatment, we investigate counterfactual productivity levels in a quasi-experimental setting. For our purpose, we exploit a control group of non-temporary exporters that have already sustained the fixed costs of reaching foreign markets, thus controlling for self-selection into exporting. Our findings reveal a non-linear relationship between export intensity and productivity, with small albeit statistically significant benefits ranging from 0.1% to 0.6% per year only after exports reach 60% of total revenues. After we look at sales, variable costs, capital intensity, and the propensity to filing patents, we show that, before the 60% threshold, economies of scale and capital adjustment offset each other and induce, on average, a minimal albeit statistically significant loss in productivity of about 0.01% per year. Crucially, we find that heterogeneous export intensity is associated with the firm's position on the technological frontier, as the propensity to file a patent increases when export intensity ranges in 8%-60% with a peak at 40%. The latest finding further highlights that learning-by-exporting is linked to the building of absorptive capacity.","creator":"Giovanni Cerulli, Francesca Micocci, Armando Rungi","topic":"economics"}
