Thanks to cutting-edge AI frameworks, we're one step closer to achieving this utopia!","text":"In today's data-driven landscape, accurate decision-making relies heavily on the quality of the underlying data. However, with the exponential growth of big data, ensuring data accuracy has become a daunting task. Poor data quality can lead to misleading conclusions, wasted resources, and even catastrophic failures. The current approaches to addressing this issue are often fragmented, focusing on specific metrics while neglecting other vital aspects of data quality. Moreover, these methods tend to be context-specific, limiting their applicability across different domains. To tackle this challenge, innovative AI-driven frameworks have emerged as a beacon of hope. This groundbreaking research proposes a novel set of interconnected frameworks designed to enhance big data quality comprehensively. The first framework introduces new quality metrics and a weighted scoring system for precise data quality assessment. This is followed by a generic framework that leverages AI models to detect various quality anomalies. Next, an innovative framework utilizes predictive modeling to correct detected anomalies. Additionally, the research addresses metadata quality enhancement within big data ecosystems. These frameworks have been rigorously tested on diverse datasets, demonstrating their efficacy in improving big data quality. By harnessing the power of AI, we can now automate data quality corrections, enabling businesses and organizations to make informed decisions with confidence. This technology has far-reaching implications, from optimizing supply chains to revolutionizing healthcare. As we continue to push the boundaries of what is possible, one thing is clear â€“ the future of data quality is brighter than ever!","title":"AI-Driven Frameworks for Enhancing Data Quality in Big Data Ecosystems: Error Detection, Correction, and Metadata Integration","link":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03870","id":"2405.03870","slug":"ai-driven-frameworks-for-enhancing-data-quality-in-big-data-ecosystems-error-detection-correction-and-metadata-integration","creator":"Widad Elouataoui","topic":"artificial-intelligence"}
