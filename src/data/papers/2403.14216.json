That's the promise of a new study that introduces a sophisticated model capable of predicting how the US economy will adapt to severe weather shocks, even as they become more frequent.\n\nThis is a game changer in understanding and preparing for the future of our planet. The study uses a new smooth transition vector autoregressive model with a Gaussian conditional distribution, where the transition weights depend on the full distribution of the preceding observations. This data-driven approach allows for capturing complex switching dynamics and identifying gradual regime shifts.\n\nThe researchers applied this model to monthly US data from 1961:1 to 2022:3, examining the macroeconomic effects of a severe weather shock. The findings suggest that in certain crisis periods and in the early part of the sample, the impacts of the shock are stronger than in the regime dominating the latter part of the sample. This suggests overall adaptation of the US economy to increased severe weather over time.\n\nThis study offers hope for climate change resilience, as it shows that even in the face of severe weather shocks, the US economy can adapt and thrive. As we continue to grapple with the realities of a changing climate, models like this one will be essential in helping us prepare for and mitigate the economic impacts of severe weather events.","title":"Revolutionary Model Predicts Climate Change Resilience in the US Economy","link":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14216","id":"2403.14216","slug":"revolutionary-model-predicts-climate-change-resilience-in-the-us-economy","creator":"Markku Lanne, Savi Virolainen","topic":"economics"}
