{"title":"Breaking Down the Limits of Empirical Finance: A New Perspective on Causality","summary":"Challenging traditional views of causality in financial markets, this article explores the potential of alternative approaches to understanding risk and uncertainty.","intro":"Imagine a world where financial predictions are no longer based on simplistic cause-and-effect models, but rather on a deeper understanding of the complex interplay between variables. Welcome to the future of empirical finance, where the limitations of traditional causal reductionism are being pushed beyond their epistemic limits.","text":"In this groundbreaking research, we delve into the shortcomings of conventional methods in empirical finance and propose a novel approach that acknowledges the self-referential nature of capital markets. By embracing the complexity of these systems, we can better account for the intricate web of causal relationships that shape market behavior. Our findings have far-reaching implications for the way we understand and analyze financial risks, paving the way for more accurate predictions and informed decision-making.","keywords":["causality, empirical finance, self-reference, complexity, predictive modeling"],"prompt":"An AI-generated image of a futuristic trading floor with holographic displays and humming machinery, surrounded by a team of quantitative analysts studying market data with intense focus.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16570","id":"2311.16570","slug":"breaking-down-the-limits-of-empirical-finance-a-new-perspective-on-causality","creator":"Daniel Polakow, Tim Gebbie, Emlyn Flint","topic":"economics"}
