{"title":"Holmes: Automated Fact Check with Large Language Models","summary":"Revolutionary AI framework, Holmes, detects disinformation with 90% accuracy using Large Language Models and novel evidence retrieval.","intro":"Imagine a world where truth prevails, and fake news is a thing of the past. Welcome to the future, where AI is the ultimate detective!","text":"In a world where information travels at lightning speed, distinguishing fact from fiction has become a daunting task. Disinformation, in its various forms, threatens to undermine trust, mislead decision-making, and jeopardize national security. The stakes are high, but so are the rewards for those who can harness the power of Artificial Intelligence (AI) to combat this menace. Enter Holmes, a pioneering AI framework that is redefining the landscape of fact-checking. Holmes leverages the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), sophisticated AI systems trained on vast amounts of data, to identify and debunk false claims. The journey begins with the understanding that LLMs, while incredibly powerful, have limitations when it comes to verifying the truthfulness of statements on their own. They require evidence, and not just any evidence, but high-quality, relevant information that can stand up to scrutiny. To address this need, the creators of Holmes have developed an innovative evidence retrieval method. This method involves summarizing key information from open sources using LLMs, coupled with a novel algorithm and metrics designed to assess the quality of the evidence gathered. The result is an end-to-end framework that enables LLMs to not only verify claims but also generate justifications for their verdicts, making the fact-checking process more transparent and trustworthy. The effectiveness of Holmes has been rigorously tested on open-source datasets and in real-time verification tasks, with astonishing results. Achieving an accuracy of 88.3% on the datasets and a remarkable 90.2% in real-world scenarios, Holmes outperforms existing methods by a significant margin, with a 30.8% improvement in fact-checking accuracy over traditional approaches. The implications of this breakthrough are profound. With Holmes, the potential to safeguard the integrity of information is vast, benefiting not just individuals but society at large. From news organizations seeking to verify the authenticity of their reports to governments aiming to protect their citizens from misinformation, the applications are endless. As we move forward, the integration of AI in combating disinformation represents a beacon of hope. It is a testament to human ingenuity and the relentless pursuit of truth in the digital age. With tools like Holmes, we are not just fighting fake news; we are building a future where information is a force for good, empowering us to make informed decisions and fostering a more transparent, trustworthy world.","keywords":["AI Fact-Checking","Disinformation Detection","Large Language Models","Evidence Retrieval","Future of Information Integrity"],"prompt":"Generate an image that combines elements of detective work and futuristic AI, with a cityscape in the background.

Disinformation has evolved from simple text to complex multimodal forms combining images and text, challenging existing detection methods. Traditional deep learning models struggle to capture the complexity of multimodal disinformation. Inspired by advances in AI, this study explores using Large Language Models (LLMs) for automated disinformation detection. The empirical study shows that (1) LLMs alone cannot reliably assess the truthfulness of claims; (2) providing relevant evidence significantly improves their performance; (3) however, LLMs cannot autonomously search for accurate evidence. To address this, we propose Holmes, an end-to-end framework featuring a novel evidence retrieval method that assists LLMs in collecting high-quality evidence. Our approach uses (1) LLM-powered summarization to extract key information from open sources and (2) a new algorithm and metrics to evaluate evidence quality. Holmes enables LLMs to verify claims and generate justifications effectively. Experiments show Holmes achieves 88.3% accuracy on two open-source datasets and 90.2% in real-time verification tasks.
