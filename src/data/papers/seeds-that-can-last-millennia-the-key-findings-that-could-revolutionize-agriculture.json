{"title":"Seeds that Can Last Millennia: The Key Findings that Could Revolutionize Agriculture","summary":"Scientists have discovered a crucial mechanism that governs the longevity of seeds, which may enable us to revolutionize farming and preserve plant diversity.","intro":"Imagine a future where the world's food supply is no longer at risk of running out after just a few short years. What if we could grow crops from seeds that can last millennia, ensuring our crops survive in even the toughest of conditions? That future may be closer than we think, thanks to a groundbreaking discovery by scientists studying the mechanisms behind seed longevity. By studying mutations in Arabidopsis plants, they have uncovered vital information about the vital role that metacaspases play in modulating proteolytic mechanisms, prolonging the life of seeds by breaking down misfolded proteins.","keywords":["Seed longevity","Proteolytic mechanisms","Metacaspases","Arabidopsis plants","Agriculture"],"prompt":"a futuristic farm where crops that last for centuries are grown and harvested in a sustainable way.","link":"http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2023.03.19.533321v1?rss=1","id":"e961f88bc944c8012156f8a4cc9064dd","slug":"seeds-that-can-last-millennia-the-key-findings-that-could-revolutionize-agriculture","imageSlug":"an-image-of-a-futuristic-farm-where-crops-that-last-for-centuries-are-grown-and-harvested-in-a-sustainable-way","creator":"Liu, C., Hatzianestis, I.
