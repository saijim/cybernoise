Using molecular sequence data from two markers (ITS1-5.8S-ITS2 and rps16) and combined morphological characteristics, they were able to describe and illustrate these unique plants.\n\nPolycarpaea vanana is a stunning plant with a glabrous stem and ovate to elliptic, glabrous leaves. The ovary of this species is oblong ovoid, and the base is obtuse, while the apex is attenuate. The capsule is also oblong void and measures 3.8 mm long. This species shares similarities with Polycarpaea gaudichaudi, P. arenaria, and P. duongana but can be distinguished by its unique characteristics.\n\nPolycarpaea duongana is another remarkable plant species, with a densely villous stem and spathulate, ciliate leaves. The ovary of this species is ovoid, and the base is acute, while the apex is obtuse. The capsule is ovoid and measures 1.2 mm long. This species shares similarities with P. vanana but can be distinguished by its unique characteristics.\n\nPolycarpaea chungana is most closely related to P. lignosa but has distinct leaf features, including oblong or linear, sparse ciliate leaves. The sepals and petals of this species have a deeply concaved or slightly bifid apex, while the ovary is ovoid and measures 0.8-1.0 mm long.\n\nThe analysis using molecular data also revealed new insights into the systematic positions of seven other species of Polycarpaea, further expanding our understanding of this fascinating plant family. This research highlights the power of combining molecular and morphological approaches to uncover cryptic morphology and taxonomic novelties in the natural world.","title":"Scientists Discover Three New Species of Polycarpaea from Vietnam Using Molecular and Morphological Approaches","link":"http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2024.03.18.585622v1?rss=1","id":"2024.03.18.585622v1","slug":"scientists-discover-three-new-species-of-polycarpaea-from-vietnam-using-molecular-and-morphological-approaches","creator":"Tran, T.
