Our innovative approach harnesses the power of synthetic data and semantic generative augmentations to revolutionize the field of few-shot counting.","text":"In this game-changing paper, we explore the potential of synthetic data in enhancing few-shot class-agnostic counting, a task that remains a significant challenge in computer vision. By leveraging the capabilities of text-to-image diffusion models and our proposed double conditioning method with both prompts and density maps, we demonstrate substantial improvements in accuracy and diversity of generated images. Our experiments on FSC147 and CARPK showcase the effectiveness of our approach, paving the way for a new era of efficient and accurate few-shot counting applications.","keywords":["few-shot counting","synthetic data","semantic generative augmentations","text-to-image diffusion models","double conditioning"],"prompt":"a futuristic cityscape with flying cars and towering skyscrapers, but with a twist - every object is labeled with a number indicating how many of that object there are in the scene.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16122","id":"2311.16122","slug":"revolutionary-breakthrough-in-few-shot-counting-leveraging-synthetic-data-with-semantic-generative-augmentations","creator":"Perla Doubinsky (CEDRIC - VERTIGO, CNAM), Nicolas Audebert (CEDRIC - VERTIGO, CNAM), Michel Crucianu (CEDRIC - VERTIGO), Herv&#xe9; Le Borgne (CEA)","topic":"artificial-intelligence"}
