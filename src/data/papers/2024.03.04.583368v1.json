{"title":"The Breakthrough Role of Periplasmic Enzyme CAH1 in Boosting Carbon Uptake in Algae","summary":"Discover how the enzyme CAH1 enhances algae's ability to absorb carbon, especially in low-CO2 conditions.","intro":"Imagine a world where we harness the power of algae to combat climate change by capturing and converting CO2 into valuable resources. Recent scientific breakthroughs have brought us one step closer to this reality, shedding light on the crucial role of a periplasmic enzyme called CAH1 in boosting carbon uptake in algae, particularly under CO2-limiting conditions.\n","text":"Carbonic anhydrase (CA) is a vital enzyme found across various species, playing a pivotal role in the conversion of inorganic carbon (Ci; CO2 and HCO3-) forms. While intracellular CA has been thoroughly studied, the specific function of extracellular CA in photosynthetic organisms remains elusive.\n\nResearchers have turned their attention to Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, a type of green alga with a periplasmic carbonic anhydrase named CAH1. This enzyme is strongly induced under CO2-limiting conditions by the Myb transcription factor LCR1.\n\nIn this study, researchers identified 12 LCR1-dependent inducible genes under CO2-limiting conditions and focused on four key ones: CAH1, LCI1, LCI6, and Cre10.g426800. They created mutants of these genes using the CRISPR-Cas9 system, all from the same parental strain, and compared their Ci-affinity.\n\nSurprisingly, the newly developed cah1-1 mutant exhibited a significant decrease in Ci-affinity under high HCO3-/CO2-ratio conditions. This finding contradicts previous research (Van and Spalding, 1999) that reported no reduction in Ci-affinity in the cah1 mutant.\n\nTo further investigate, scientists treated wild-type cells with a CA inhibitor having low membrane permeability, which resulted in a similar decrease in Ci-affinity. Intriguingly, adding exogenous CA to the cah1 mutant restored its decreased Ci-affinity.\n\nThese results emphasize the critical role of periplasmic CAH1 in maintaining high Ci-affinity in Chlamydomonas cells under low-CO2 conditions. This breakthrough discovery paves the way for developing more efficient algae strains capable of capturing and converting CO2 into valuable resources, ultimately contributing to a greener and more sustainable future.\n\nKeywords: carbonic anhydrase, Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, periplasmic space, CRISPR-Cas9, CO2-limiting conditions\n","keywords":["carbonic anhydrase","Chlamydomonas reinhardtii","periplasmic space","CRISPR-Cas9","CO2-limiting conditions"],"prompt":"A vibrant, futuristic image of algae absorbing CO2 through periplasmic carbonic anhydrase CAH1 under a glowing blue light, surrounded by a neon green and blue environment with geometric shapes.","link":"http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2024.03.04.583368v1?rss=1","id":"2024.03.04.583368v1","slug":"the-breakthrough-role-of-periplasmic-enzyme-cah1-in-boosting-carbon-uptake-in-algae","creator":"Shimamura, D., Ikeuchi, T., Tsuji, Y., Fukuzawa, H., Yamano, T.","topic":"plant-biology"}
