Discover how news events could be shaping markets and influencing investor behavior in unexpected ways!","text":"Market instability often leaves traders wide-eyed as they ride the relentless roller coaster of fluctuating asset values. The reason for these chaotic waves? The answer could simply be - news events. Interestingly, market volatility isn't as erratic as we perceive. In fact, it follows two fascinating 'laws'. Assets tend to show 'fat-tails' - an unusually large chance of extreme variations, and these variations often cluster together over time. Amidst all this pandemonium, there are two kinds of financial market participants - long-term investors and short-term speculators with drastically contrasting navigation strategies. Their interaction with news and each other gives us an insight into the market's radiant chaos.\n\nLong-term investors' valuation of an asset takes on a news-driven random walk. This means they have a clingy memory, retaining fundamental news persistently. Meanwhile, short-term speculators exhibit a shorter memory of news and tend to follow a news-driven trend. This effectively encapsulates their shortsighted, trend-following or ‘herding’ mentality.\n\nNow, how do these dichotomous behaviors impact market volatility? As long-term investors react to news, they seed an initial wave of volatility due to their enduring memory of these events. Then enter the short-term speculators, whose reactions to the same news not only amplify this wave but also lead to the clustering of volatility as they 'herd' together, boosting the extremeness of these variations.\n\nThe beauty of this dynamic is its simplicity and robustness. It doesn’t require any assumptions as in the case of Rational expectations - the prevalent model, which represents a utopian trader mindset and falls short because it doesn’t reflect the no-speculation, no-trade reality of the market sphere. In essence, the market's enigmatic turbulence elegantly mirrors the dance between news events and the contrasting psyches of long-term investors and short-term speculators, creating an open canvas for high-stake interactions.","keywords":["Market Volatility","News Impact","Long-term Investors","Short-term Speculators","Financial Markets"],"prompt":"An abstract representation of a volatile stock market being influenced by news, with figures representing long-term investors and short-term speculators reacting to it.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.04876","id":"2309.04876","slug":"unraveling-the-impact-of-news-on-market-volatility-delving-into-the-psyche-of-investors-and-speculators","creator":"Sabiou Inoua","topic":"economics"}
