{"title":"Securing the Future of Machine Learning: Verifying Rules on Large-Scale Neural Network Training","summary":"A new mechanism has been developed to verify whether large-scale neural network (NN) training is carried out in compliance with agreed-upon rules.","intro":"As society increasingly relies on advanced machine learning systems, it is imperative that governments enforce development rules and countries verify each other's compliance. With the aim of providing high confidence in ML chip usage, a framework has been created to monitor computing hardware used for large-scale NN training. Read on to find out how this helps secure the future of machine learning!","keywords":["Machine learning","rule verification","neural network training","compliance","chip supply chain"],"prompt":"an image of a futuristic government official monitoring a neural network on a large screen, with multiple layers of security in the background.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11341","id":"5464f3266bf74fc01f4435b16ffd3073","slug":"securing-the-future-of-machine-learning-verifying-rules-on-large-scale-neural-network-training","imageSlug":"generate-an-image-of-a-futuristic-government-official-monitoring-a-neural-network-on-a-large-screen-with-multiple-layers-of-security-in-the-background","creator":"Yonadav Shavit"}
