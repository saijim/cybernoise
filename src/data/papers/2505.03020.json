{"title":"The Multimodal Paradox: How Added and Missing Modalities Shape Bias and Performance in Multimodal AI","summary":"New research reveals that adding or removing data types can dramatically impact AI performance and fairness, paving the way for more robust and equitable multimodal systems.","intro":"Imagine a world where AI systems can make decisions that are not only more accurate but also more fair. Sounds like science fiction, right? But what if the key to unlocking this reality lies in understanding the mysterious ways that different data types interact with each other? Dive into the fascinating world of multimodal AI and discover the surprising truth about the power of missing data.","text":"In the rapidly evolving landscape of artificial intelligence, multimodal learning has emerged as a game-changer. By integrating diverse data sources such as images, text, and structured data, multimodal AI systems have proven superior to their unimodal counterparts in high-stakes decision-making. However, beneath the surface of performance gains lies a complex web of concerns around bias and robustness. Recent research has shed light on the intriguing dynamics at play, revealing that the addition or removal of data modalities can have a profound impact on both performance and fairness. The study's findings suggest that incorporating new modalities during training consistently enhances the performance of multimodal models, while fairness trends exhibit variability across different evaluation measures and datasets. Perhaps most strikingly, the absence of modalities at inference time degrades both performance and fairness, raising concerns about the robustness of multimodal models in real-world deployment. As we move forward, it's clear that understanding the intricacies of multimodal AI will be crucial in unlocking its full potential. By embracing the complexity of multimodal systems and addressing the challenges that come with them, we can create more robust, equitable, and high-performing AI systems that revolutionize industries and transform lives. The future of AI is multimodal, and it's brighter than ever.","keywords":["Multimodal AI","Fairness","Robustness","Data Modalities","AI Performance"],"prompt":"Generate an image that captures the essence of multimodal AI, with a futuristic cityscape in the background and diverse data streams converging into a central hub, reminiscent of Syd Mead's concept art and Ashley Wood's vibrant color palette, with a dash of Syd Barrett's psychedelic flair.","id":"2505.03020","slug":"revolutionizing-ai-the-surprising-power-of-missing-data","link":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03020","abstract":"Abstract: Multimodal learning, which integrates diverse data sources such as images, text, and structured data, has proven superior to unimodal counterparts in high-stakes decision-making. However, while performance gains remain the gold standard for evaluating multimodal systems, concerns around bias and robustness are frequently overlooked. In this context, this paper explores two key research questions (RQs): (i) RQ1 examines whether adding a modality con-sistently enhances performance and investigates its role in shaping fairness measures, assessing whether it mitigates or amplifies bias in multimodal models; (ii) RQ2 investigates the impact of missing modalities at inference time, analyzing how multimodal models generalize in terms of both performance and fairness. Our analysis reveals that incorporating new modalities during training consistently enhances the performance of multimodal models, while fairness trends exhibit variability across different evaluation measures and datasets. Additionally, the absence of modalities at inference degrades performance and fairness, raising concerns about its robustness in real-world deployment. We conduct extensive experiments using multimodal healthcare datasets containing images, time series, and structured information to validate our findings.","creator":"Kishore Sampath, Pratheesh, Ayaazuddin Mohammad, Resmi Ramachandranpillai","topic":"artificial-intelligence"}
