Sounds like science fiction? Think again! A groundbreaking new methodology is set to revolutionize the world of scientific research, and we're here to give you the inside scoop.","text":"The world of scientific research is on the cusp of a revolution, and it's all thanks to the power of Artificial Intelligence (AI). For years, the peer review process has been a bottleneck in the scientific community, with experts struggling to keep up with the sheer volume of research being published. But now, a new AI-driven approach is set to change the game. The innovative methodology, known as Persistent Workflow Prompting (PWP), has been designed to work with standard Large Language Models (LLMs) to analyze scientific manuscripts with unprecedented accuracy and speed. By using a hierarchical, modular architecture, PWP guides the LLM through a systematic evaluation of the research, identifying major methodological flaws and performing complex tasks with ease. The results are nothing short of remarkable, with the AI system able to distinguish claims from evidence, integrate text and image analysis, and even execute quantitative feasibility checks. And the best part? This technology is not limited to just one field of research - it has the potential to be applied across the scientific spectrum, from chemistry to physics and beyond. As we move forward into a future where AI and humans collaborate in the pursuit of scientific discovery, it's clear that the possibilities are endless. With PWP leading the charge, we can expect to see faster, more accurate, and more reliable research, paving the way for breakthroughs in some of the world's most pressing challenges. The future of science has never looked brighter.","keywords":["AI in Science","Peer Review","Scientific Research","Large Language Models","Future of Science"],"prompt":"Generate an image in the style of Syd Mead and H.R.

This report introduces Persistent Workflow Prompting (PWP), a potentially broadly applicable prompt engineering methodology designed to bridge this gap using standard LLM chat interfaces (zero-code, no APIs). We present a proof-of-concept PWP prompt for the critical analysis of experimental chemistry manuscripts, featuring a hierarchical, modular architecture (structured via Markdown) that defines detailed analysis workflows. We develop this PWP prompt through iterative application of meta-prompting techniques and meta-reasoning aimed at systematically codifying expert review workflows, including tacit knowledge. Submitted once at the start of a session, this PWP prompt equips the LLM with persistent workflows triggered by subsequent queries, guiding modern reasoning LLMs through systematic, multimodal evaluations. Demonstrations show the PWP-guided LLM identifying major methodological flaws in a test case while mitigating LLM input bias and performing complex tasks, including distinguishing claims from evidence, integrating text/photo/figure analysis to infer parameters, executing quantitative feasibility checks, comparing estimates against claims, and assessing a priori plausibility. To ensure transparency and facilitate replication, we provide full prompts, detailed demonstration analyses, and logs of interactive chats as supplementary resources. Beyond the specific application, this work offers insights into the meta-development process itself, highlighting the potential of PWP, informed by detailed workflow formalization, to enable sophisticated analysis using readily available LLMs for complex scientific tasks.","creator":"Evgeny Markhasin","topic":"artificial-intelligence"}
