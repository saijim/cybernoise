{"title":"Revolutionary discovery in membrane fusion: Tyrosine phosphorylation controls VAMP721 functionality","summary":"Researchers have discovered that the phosphorylation of a specific tyrosine residue in the Longin domain of R-SNARE VAMP721 modulates its ability to interact with other SNARE proteins and regulate membrane fusion.","intro":"The age-old mystery of how our body's cells communicate with one another may have been solved thanks to a groundbreaking new discovery in the field of membrane fusion. Scientists have found that the chemical modification of a specific tyrosine residue in R-SNARE VAMP721 enables it to interact more readily with other SNARE proteins, leading to more efficient membrane fusion and ultimately, a healthier body!","keywords":["membrane fusion","tyrosine phosphorylation","SNARE proteins","Longin domain","VAMP721"],"prompt":"two cells fusing together, with the VAMP721 and SNARE proteins highlighted in bright colors to emphasize their importance in the process.","link":"http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2023.03.18.533296v1?rss=1","id":"de25c689c91bc9adf9128da939c78fa3","slug":"revolutionary-discovery-in-membrane-fusion-tyrosine-phosphorylation-controls-vamp721-functionality","imageSlug":"an-image-of-two-cells-fusing-together-with-the-vamp721-and-snare-proteins-highlighted-in-bright-colors-to-emphasize-their-importance-in-the-process","creator":"Ricardi, M.
