{"title":"Revolutionary Privacy-Preserving Framework Boosts Recommendation Accuracy Across Domains","summary":"A new privacy-preserving framework uses multi-modal data to learn more informative domain-common and domain-specific features, improving recommendation accuracy in a target domain with sparse data.","intro":"Get ready for a game-changing recommendation system that not only enhances accuracy but also protects user privacy. This groundbreaking framework leverages multi-modal data to learn more informative features, revolutionizing cross-domain recommendations.","text":"Cross-domain recommendation (CDR) is a powerful tool to improve recommendation accuracy in a target domain with sparse data by utilizing rich information from a source domain. However, existing CDR methods often rely on simple user-item historical interaction information, neglecting the wealth of multi-modal features available. Moreover, these methods may not effectively disentangle domain-common and domain-specific components, leading to suboptimal results.\n\nTo address these challenges, researchers have developed a Privacy-Preserving Framework with Multi-Modal Data for Cross-Domain Recommendation (P2M2-CDR). This revolutionary framework first designs a multi-modal disentangled encoder that utilizes multi-modal information to disentangle more informative domain-common and domain-specific embeddings. By doing so, P2M2-CDR can learn more comprehensive user and item representations, improving recommendation accuracy.\n\nIn addition to its impressive performance, P2M2-CDR also prioritizes user privacy. The framework introduces a privacy-preserving decoder that mitigates user privacy leakage during knowledge transfer. Local differential privacy (LDP) is utilized to obfuscate the disentangled embeddings before inter-domain exchange, further enhancing privacy protection.\n\nTo ensure both consistency and differentiation among these obfuscated disentangled embeddings, P2M2-CDR incorporates contrastive learning-based domain-inter and domain-intra losses. Extensive experiments conducted on four real-world datasets demonstrate that P2M2-CDR outperforms other state-of-the-art single-domain and cross-domain baselines.\n\nIn summary, P2M2-CDR is a powerful and privacy-preserving framework that leverages multi-modal data to improve recommendation accuracy across domains. Its cutting-edge technology has the potential to revolutionize the way we approach recommendations in the future.","keywords":["privacy-preserving","cross-domain recommendation","multi-modal data","disentangled embeddings","local differential privacy"],"prompt":"A high-tech, futuristic privacy-preserving framework that uses multi-modal data for cross-domain recommendations, with a sleek and modern design featuring holographic displays and interconnected data points.","link":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03600","id":"2403.03600","slug":"revolutionary-privacy-preserving-framework-boosts-recommendation-accuracy-across-domains","creator":"Li Wang, Lei Sang, Quangui Zhang, Qiang Wu, Min Xu","topic":"artificial-intelligence"}
