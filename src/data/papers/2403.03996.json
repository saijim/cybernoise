{"title":"A Paradigm Shift in Urban Flood Risk Assessment","summary":"Discover how healthcare ideas are revolutionizing urban flood risk assessment with a new three-pillar perspective.","intro":"Healthcare and flood risk management may seem unrelated, but innovative thinkers are combining their expertise to create a groundbreaking approach to city safety. This revolutionary method, inspired by the principles of health risk assessment, provides fresh insights into urban flooding risks.","text":"The new perspective for flood risk assessment consists of three main components: inherent susceptibility, mitigation strategies, and external stressors. These pillars represent the physical and environmental features of urban areas, human interventions, and unpredictable outside elements. By examining these factors together, experts can better understand how they interact to create flood risks.\n\nInherent susceptibility refers to the inherent qualities of an area that contribute to its vulnerability to flooding, such as topography or drainage capacity. Mitigation strategies involve measures taken by humans to protect against floods, such as building levees or implementing zoning regulations.\n\nFinally, external stressors represent unpredictable factors beyond human control, like climate change or extreme weather events. Together, these three pillars offer a comprehensive view of urban flooding risks.\n\nThe new perspective emphasizes evaluating pathways to high flood risk rather than seeking precise quantification and prediction at fine resolutions. By examining the individual and collective impacts of each pillar, experts can better understand how changes in specific factors within each category contribute to enhanced or exacerbated flood risks.\n\nThis novel approach aims to complement existing assessment frameworks by offering a nuanced perspective on urban flooding risks. The three-pillars model enables decision-makers and planners to make informed choices, leading to effective action for flood risk reduction.","keywords":["health risk assessment","flood risk assessment","urban flooding","risk pathways","mitigation"],"prompt":"A futuristic city skyline at sunset with a holographic graph showing flood risk factors overlaying the buildings","link":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03996","id":"2403.03996","slug":"a-paradigm-shift-in-urban-flood-risk-assessment","creator":"Zhewei Liu, Kai Yin, Ali Mostafavi","topic":"artificial-intelligence"}
