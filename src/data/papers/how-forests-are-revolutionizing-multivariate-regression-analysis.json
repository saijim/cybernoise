{"title":"How Forests Are Revolutionizing Multivariate Regression Analysis","summary":"We introduce a new forest-based estimator that can better model multivariate scores in regression discontinuity designs, outperforming traditional methods in simulations.","intro":"In the world of statistics, multivariate regression discontinuity designs have long posed a challenge for researchers trying to estimate treatment effects with multiple scores. But now, thanks to the power of forests, a new estimator has been created that not only outperforms traditional methods, but is also much simpler and more flexible in handling large datasets. Read on to discover the future of multivariate regression using forests!","keywords":["forests","regression discontinuity designs","multivariate scores","estimator","local linear regressions"],"prompt":"an image of a lush forest with a regression line cutting through it, symbolizing the improved accuracy and flexibility of using forests in multivariate regression analysis.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11721","id":"0883133f2e6d480cf761a9e0ce8d15d7","slug":"how-forests-are-revolutionizing-multivariate-regression-analysis","imageSlug":"generate-an-image-of-a-lush-forest-with-a-regression-line-cutting-through-it-symbolizing-the-improved-accuracy-and-flexibility-of-using-forests-in-multivariate-regression-analysis","creator":"Yiqi Liu, Yuan Qi"}
