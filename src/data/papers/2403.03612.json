{"title":"Revolutionizing Online Advertising: How New Technologies Reduce Perceived Privacy Violations","summary":"New online advertising practices are reducing consumers' perceived privacy violations (PPVs), but not as much as you might think. A study using the dual-privacy framework found that while new technologies keep data on the consumer's machine, they only slightly lower PPV compared to behavioral targeting. However, contextual targeting, where there is no tracking, significantly reduces PPV.","intro":"Are you tired of feeling like your privacy is being violated by online ads? Good news! New technologies are reducing perceived privacy violations (PPVs) in online advertising, according to a study using the dual-privacy framework. But don't get too excited yet - the reduction may not be as much as you think.","text":"Online advertising has long been plagued by concerns about collecting and using personal data, leading to privacy violations. However, the industry has been developing privacy-enhancing technologies (PETs), such as Google's Privacy Sandbox initiative, to address these concerns. A study using the dual-privacy framework, which postulates that consumers have intrinsic and instrumental preferences for privacy, aimed to understand consumers' PPVs for current and proposed online advertising practices.\n\nThe findings confirm that tracking and targeting consumers under the industry status quo of behavioral targeting leads to high PPV. However, new technologies or proposals that ensure that data are kept on the consumer's machine lower PPV relative to behavioral targeting but, importantly, this decrease is small.\n\nInterestingly, group-level targeting does not differ significantly from individual-level targeting in reducing PPV. Under contextual targeting, where there is no tracking, PPV is significantly reduced, and consumers are indifferent between seeing untargeted ads and no ads when they are not being tracked.\n\nThe study highlights the importance of a consumer-centric approach to privacy in online advertising. While technical definitions may suggest that certain practices do not violate privacy, consumer perceptions may differ. Therefore, it is crucial to consider both technical and consumer perspectives when developing and implementing PETs.","keywords":["online advertising","privacy-enhancing technologies","dual-privacy framework","perceived privacy violations"],"prompt":"A futuristic cyberpunk scene with a holographic display showing targeted ads without tracking or data collection, surrounded by neon lights and high-tech buildings in the background","link":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03612","id":"2403.03612","slug":"revolutionizing-online-advertising-how-new-technologies-reduce-perceived-privacy-violations","creator":"Kinshuk Jerath, Klaus M.
