{"title":"Strategic Effort and Bandwagon Effects in Finite Multi-Stage Games with Non-Linear Externalities: Evidence from Triathlon","summary":"A new study reveals the secret to winning in triathlons: swimming in formation can boost your rank by over 30% on average.","intro":"Imagine being able to shave off precious seconds, even minutes, from your triathlon time simply by swimming in the right formation. Sounds like science fiction, right? But what if we told you that a groundbreaking study has cracked the code to unlocking the ultimate competitive edge in the swimming stage of triathlons?","text":"For years, athletes and coaches have known that drafting - swimming directly behind another competitor - can save energy and improve performance. But the exact impact of this technique on overall success has remained a mystery. Now, a pioneering study has shed new light on the phenomenon, revealing that swimming in the right formation can have a profound impact on an athlete's finishing rank. By analyzing data from triathlons, including those affected by COVID-19 drafting bans in Austria, researchers were able to isolate the causal effect of drafting on performance. The results are nothing short of astonishing: in small groups of swimmers (fewer than 10 athletes), each additional swimmer behind an athlete can improve their finishing rank by over 30% on average. While the benefits diminish in larger groups, the study's findings have significant implications for athletes, coaches, and the future of competitive swimming. By understanding the optimal positioning and drafting strategies, athletes can gain a crucial competitive edge. The study's results also open up new possibilities for the development of advanced training programs and innovative technologies designed to help athletes maximize their performance. As the sports world continues to evolve, it's clear that the science of drafting is set to revolutionize the way we approach competition. With the potential to shave precious seconds off times, swimming in sync is no longer just a tactic - it's a game-changer.","keywords":["Triathlon","Drafting","Performance Enhancement","Sports Science","Competitive Edge"],"prompt":"Generate an image in the style of Syd Mead and H.R.

Focusing on open-water swim draftingwhere athletes reduce drag most effectively by swimming directly behind peerswe estimate its performance effects through a structural contest framework with endogenous, deterministic effort and drafting position. Leveraging exogenous variation from COVID-19 drafting bans in Austrian triathlons, we apply a panel leave-one-out (LOO/LOTO) peer ability instrumental variables (IV) strategy to isolate the causal non-linear effect of drafting. Results from restricted sample analysis and pooled estimated bandwagon IV effects show substantial and nonlinear gains: in small (group size below 10) drafting swim groups/clusters, each deeper position improves finishing rank on average by over 30%, with rapidly diminishing returns in larger groups. Leading however is consistently more costly than optimal positioning, aligning with theoretical predictions of energy expenditure (metabolic costs).","creator":"Felix Reichel","topic":"economics"}
