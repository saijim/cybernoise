{"title":"SheetAgent: The Future of Spreadsheet Manipulation with Large Language Models","summary":"A novel autonomous agent, SheetAgent, utilizes the power of large language models to achieve advanced reasoning and accurate manipulation over spreadsheets without human interaction. This groundbreaking technology delivers impressive results on multiple benchmarks, demonstrating superior table reasoning abilities.","intro":"Get ready for a revolution in spreadsheet manipulation! SheetAgent, a new autonomous agent that harnesses the power of large language models, is set to transform the way we interact with spreadsheets. With its advanced reasoning and accurate manipulation capabilities, SheetAgent requires no human interaction, making it an essential tool for the future of work.","text":"Spreadsheet manipulation is a common task in many daily work activities, significantly improving efficiency. However, existing large language models (LLMs) have not been thoroughly investigated for automatic spreadsheet manipulation, particularly in complicated and realistic tasks where reasoning challenges exist. To address this gap, researchers introduce SheetRM, a benchmark featuring long-horizon and multi-category tasks with reasoning-dependent manipulation caused by real-life challenges.\n\nTo mitigate these challenges, the team proposes SheetAgent, a novel autonomous agent that utilizes LLMs' power to achieve both advanced reasoning and accurate manipulation over spreadsheets without human interaction. SheetAgent consists of three collaborative modules: Planner, Informer, and Retriever. These modules work together to perform iterative task reasoning and reflection, enhancing precision in spreadsheet manipulation and demonstrating superior table reasoning abilities.\n\nExtensive experiments have shown that SheetAgent delivers 20-30% pass rate improvements on multiple benchmarks over baselines. With these impressive results, SheetAgent is set to become an essential tool for the future of work, revolutionizing spreadsheet manipulation and enabling more efficient daily work activities.","keywords":["SheetAgent","spreadsheet manipulation","large language models","autonomous agent","iterative task reasoning"],"prompt":"A futuristic image of SheetAgent, a generalist agent for spreadsheet reasoning and manipulation via large language models, featuring a sleek and modern design with holographic interface elements and AI-generated visualizations of spreadsheets.","link":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03636","id":"2403.03636","slug":"sheetagent-the-future-of-spreadsheet-manipulation-with-large-language-models","creator":"Yibin Chen, Yifu Yuan, Zeyu Zhang, Yan Zheng, Jinyi Liu, Fei Ni, Jianye Hao","topic":"artificial-intelligence"}
