This innovative approach allows senders to design the informational environment before a single receiver commits to a posterior-dependent action profile or allocation.\n\nBy developing a novel revelation-like principle, researchers were able to characterize the set of implementable allocations in this model. They found that global incentive constraints can be pinned down by 'worst-case' punishments at finitely many posterior beliefs, whose values are independent of the allocation.\n\nMoreover, the receiver will generally benefit from the ability to randomize over deterministic outcomes when solving for the constrained optimal allocation. This is in contrast to standard mechanism design models, where such randomization is not beneficial.\n\nThe research has significant implications for a wide range of applications, including multi-good allocation problems, full surplus extraction in auctions with allocation externalities, and optimal audit design.\n\nIn particular, the study highlights the crucial role that monotone mechanisms play in these settings. By analyzing these mechanisms, researchers were able to demonstrate their potential for improving efficiency and extracting full surplus.\n\nOverall, this groundbreaking research has opened up new avenues for ex-ante mechanism design in persuasion games, with the potential to revolutionize a wide range of applications.","title":"Revolutionizing Persuasion Games: Ex-Ante Mechanism Design and Receiver Commitment","link":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02465","id":"2312.02465","slug":"revolutionizing-persuasion-games-ex-ante-mechanism-design-and-receiver-commitment","creator":"Eric Gao, Daniel Luo","topic":"economics"}
