  "intro": "Revolutionary advances in artificial intelligence are changing the way we understand and create music. In this exciting new era, scientists have developed an unsupervised learning method for harmonic analysis that relies on a hidden semi-Markov model (HSMM) and chord quality templates. This novel approach can recognize tonic without prior knowledge and provides a more accessible alternative to traditional methods that require expensive labeled data or complex rule design.",
  "text": "The study of harmony is fundamental to music theory, yet unsupervised learning of harmonic analysis has remained elusive due to the complexity involved in defining probability distributions. In this paper, the authors address this challenge by introducing chord quality templates, which specify the probability of pitch class emissions given a root note and a chord quality. These templates, combined with a hidden semi-Markov model (HSMM), enable unsupervised learning of harmonic analysis.\n\nThe HSMM is a statistical tool that models the behavior of a system as a series of states, each with its own probability distribution. In this case, the authors use the HSMM to represent the chord progression in a piece of music, where each state corresponds to a particular chord quality (e.g., major, minor, etc.). The chord quality templates then define the probability distribution for each state, allowing the model to learn the harmonic structure of the music.\n\nThe authors evaluate their proposed method using existing labeled data and compare its performance with that of existing models that use supervised learning and complex rule design. While the results show that there is still room for improvement, the proposed method has several advantages over traditional approaches. Firstly, it does not require expensive labeled data or time-consuming rule elaboration.\n\nSecondly, the authors demonstrate how to recognize the tonic without prior knowledge based on the transition probabilities of the Markov model. This is a significant advancement in unsupervised learning of harmonic analysis, as the tonic is a fundamental concept in music theory and is often difficult to identify automatically.\n\nIn conclusion, this paper presents a novel approach to unsupervised learning of harmonic analysis based on chord quality templates and a hidden semi-Markov model (HSMM). This technique offers an accessible alternative to traditional methods that require expensive labeled data or complex rule design. Furthermore, the authors' demonstration of tonic recognition without prior knowledge represents a significant step forward in unsupervised learning of harmonic analysis.",
