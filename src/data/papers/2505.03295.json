This innovative approach treats capabilities - the functions a robot or machine can perform - as contracts that AI uses to produce the necessary code. By leveraging large language models (LLMs) and a technique called retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), this method can tap into vast libraries of existing code and interfaces, allowing for the creation of skill implementations across different programming languages. The beauty of this system lies in its flexibility and customizability; users can integrate their own libraries and resource interfaces into the AI's code generation process, making it adaptable to a wide range of robotics projects. For instance, in a proof-of-concept demonstration, this method was used to control an autonomous mobile robot using Python and the Robot Operating System 2 (ROS2), showcasing its potential to streamline robotics development. With the ability to generate code quickly and accurately, developers can focus more on the creative aspects of robotics, such as designing new capabilities and applications. This breakthrough has the potential to democratize robotics development, making it accessible to a broader audience, including those without extensive programming knowledge. As this technology continues to evolve, we can expect to see rapid advancements in robotics, with more sophisticated and capable robots being developed at an unprecedented pace. The future of robotics is here, and it's being written in code - by AI.","keywords":["AI in Robotics","Code Generation","Robotics Development","Automation","Future Technology"],"prompt":"Generate an image of a futuristic robotics lab where a diverse team of engineers and developers are collaborating around a large screen displaying robot code being generated by an AI system.

Capabilities define the functions of resources in a machine-readable form and skills provide the concrete implementations that realize those capabilities. However, the development of a skill implementation conforming to a corresponding capability remains a time-consuming and challenging task. In this paper, we present a method that treats capabilities as contracts for skill implementations and leverages large language models to generate executable code based on natural language user input. A key feature of our approach is the integration of existing software libraries and interface technologies, enabling the generation of skill implementations across different target languages. We introduce a framework that allows users to incorporate their own libraries and resource interfaces into the code generation process through a retrieval-augmented generation architecture. The proposed method is evaluated using an autonomous mobile robot controlled via Python and ROS 2, demonstrating the feasibility and flexibility of the approach.","creator":"Luis Miguel Vieira da Silva, Aljosha K\\\"ocher, Nicolas K\\\"onig, Felix Gehlhoff, Alexander Fay","topic":"artificial-intelligence"}
