{"title":"Global Fairness: Achieving Equity in Healthcare Through AI in Africa","summary":"A new study finds that addressing the colonial history and income gap between countries can help make AI technologies more fair for healthcare in Africa.","intro":"As machine learning (ML) technologies become increasingly prevalent in healthcare, ensuring fairness has never been more important. In a groundbreaking study, researchers have explored fairness for global health, with a focus on Africa, to understand and mitigate biases that ML systems may exhibit. Through a scoping review and qualitative research studies with over 700 participants, the study identifies colonialism as a key attribute of interest that can cause AI systems to be biased.","text":"The study highlights three specific axes of disparities - colonial history, country of origin, and national income level - that participants believe will contribute to bias in AI systems. While experts generally agree on the relevance of colonial history for the development and implementation of AI technologies in Africa, the majority of general population participants surveyed did not see a direct link between AI and colonialism. This divergence of opinion emphasizes the importance of education and awareness-raising about the interplay between AI, health, and colonialism.\n\nTo achieve fairness in healthcare through AI in Africa, the study provides practical recommendations for developing fairness-aware ML solutions. These include involving stakeholders from diverse backgrounds in the development and implementation process, ensuring transparency and explainability of AI systems, and addressing income gaps between countries. By taking these steps, we can work towards a future where AI technologies are equitable and accessible to all, regardless of their country of origin or colonial history.\n\nThis study marks an important milestone in the quest for global fairness in healthcare through AI. As ML technologies continue to advance, it is crucial that we prioritize fairness considerations to ensure that everyone has access to high-quality, equitable healthcare.","keywords":["AI","healthcare","fairness","colonialism","Africa"],"prompt":"A futuristic image of a diverse group of people working together in an AI lab in Africa","link":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03357","id":"2403.03357","slug":"global-fairness-achieving-equity-in-healthcare-through-ai-in-africa","creator":"Mercy Asiedu, Awa Dieng, Alexander Haykel, Negar Rostamzadeh, Stephen Pfohl, Chirag Nagpal, Maria Nagawa, Abigail Oppong, Sanmi Koyejo, Katherine Heller","topic":"artificial-intelligence"}
