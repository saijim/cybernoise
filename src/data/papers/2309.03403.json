{"title":"Discover the Shocking Truth: Capital Growth Has Nothing to Do With Saving!","summary":"A groundbreaking new study reveals that capital growth isn't driven by saving or consumption, but by something entirely different. Read on to find out what it is and how it could revolutionize our understanding of the economy.","intro":"In a stunning revelation that challenges everything we thought we knew about economics, a new study has found that capital growth and acceleration have nothing to do with saving or consumption. This discovery has the potential to transform our understanding of the economy and upend traditional economic teaching and public policy.","text":"The study, published on arXiv, analyzed data from national accounts and discovered that there is no correlation between changes in net saving or consumption, as a ratio of market-value capital, and changes in the growth rate of market-value capital (capital acceleration). In other words, capital growth and acceleration appear to happen independently of saving or consumption restraint.\n\nThis finding is particularly remarkable because it goes against the conventional wisdom that capital growth is driven by savings. According to this view, when individuals and businesses save money, they are able to invest in new capital goods, which in turn leads to economic growth. However, the study found that this is not the case.\n\nSo if capital growth isn't driven by saving or consumption, what is it driven by? The study suggests that there may be other factors at play, such as technological progress or changes in the organization of production. These factors could be causing capital growth and acceleration to happen independently of saving or consumption.\n\nThe implications of this discovery are far-reaching. For one thing, it challenges the conventional wisdom that savings are the key driver of economic growth. This could have major implications for economic teaching and public policy, which have long been based on the assumption that savings are crucial for capital accumulation and growth.\n\nFurthermore, the study suggests that there may be other ways to stimulate capital growth and acceleration, beyond simply encouraging people to save more. For example, policies that promote technological progress or improve the organization of production could have a much bigger impact on capital growth than previously thought.\n\nIn short, this study has turned our understanding of the economy on its head. It shows that capital growth is not driven by saving or consumption, but by something entirely different. This discovery has the potential to revolutionize our understanding of the economy and pave the way for new approaches to economic policy.","keywords":["capital growth","saving","consumption","economic teaching","public policy"],"prompt":"A futuristic city skyline with a large, glowing graph showing exponential capital growth","link":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03403","id":"2309.03403","slug":"discover-the-shocking-truth-capital-growth-has-nothing-to-do-with-saving","creator":"Gordon Getty, Nikita Tkachenko","topic":"economics"}
