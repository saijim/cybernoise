For years, we've been relying on artificial intelligence (AI) tools like neural networks to improve our wireless systems, but these tools have their limitations. They struggle to cope with the complexities of the network environment and the growing demands of emerging use cases. But what if we could create wireless systems that are not just smart, but truly intelligent? Systems that can think, reason and adapt like humans? This is the promise of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)-Native Wireless Systems, a revolutionary technology that's about to change the game beyond 6G. To achieve this, scientists are equipping AI-native networks with common sense, enabling them to generalize and deal with unforeseen scenarios. This is made possible by exploiting different cognitive abilities such as perception, analogy, and reasoning. The perception module, for instance, can be built by abstracting real-world elements into generalizable representations, which are then used to create a world model founded on principles of causality and hyper-dimensional computing. This world model aligns with intuitive physics and enables analogical reasoning, defining common sense. But what does this mean in practice? For starters, AGI-native networks can enable use cases related to human and autonomous agents. Imagine digital twins that can think and reason like humans, synchronized and resilient experiences for cognitive avatars, and brain-level metaverse experiences like holographic teleportation. The possibilities are endless. To make this a reality, scientists are proposing intent-driven and objective-driven planning methods that maneuver the AGI-native network to take actions. Methods such as integrated information theory play a crucial role in these planning methods. As we move forward, it's essential to build AGI-native systems that can truly transform our world. This paper serves as a roadmap for the beyond 6G era, paving the way for a future where wireless networks are not just smart, but truly intelligent. So, get ready to experience the future of wireless technology like never before!","title":"Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)-Native Wireless Systems: A Journey Beyond 6G","link":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02336","id":"2405.02336","slug":"artificial-general-intelligence-agi-native-wireless-systems-a-journey-beyond-6g","creator":"Walid Saad, Omar Hashash, Christo Kurisummoottil Thomas, Christina Chaccour, Merouane Debbah, Narayan Mandayam, Zhu Han","topic":"artificial-intelligence"}
