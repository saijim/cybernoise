This vision is now one step closer to reality, thanks to a groundbreaking discovery in the field of plant breeding. A team of scientists has just uncovered the secrets of self-incompatibility in plants, a crucial mechanism that prevents self-fertilization and promotes genetic diversity. This breakthrough could have far-reaching implications for agriculture, enabling farmers to grow more resilient crops that can thrive in a rapidly changing world. So, how do plants prevent self-fertilization? The answer lies in a complex genetic system known as the self-incompatibility locus. This system is controlled by dozens of distinct alleles, which are organized in a hierarchical structure. At the heart of this system are small RNA precursors that resemble microRNAs (miRNAs), but with some key differences. These precursors trigger a robust decrease in transcript abundance of recessive pollen self-incompatibility genes, but not through the usual gene silencing pathways. Instead, they use non-canonical pathways to achieve their effects. What's more, these small RNA precursors are processed into hundreds of distinct molecules, each with its own size, abundance level, and loading preferences. This heterogeneity is reminiscent of proto-miRNAs, the evolutionary ancestors of miRNAs. But why is this important? The answer lies in the context of self-incompatibility dominance hierarchy. By processing multiple small RNA precursors from a single allele, plants can repress multiple recessive alleles, ensuring that genetic diversity is maintained. This study not only sheds light on the molecular mechanisms underlying complex dominance interactions but also provides a unique example of how evolutionary constraints shape the progression of small RNA precursors along the proto-miRNA - miRNA evolutionary continuum. The implications of this discovery are enormous. By harnessing the power of self-incompatibility, scientists could develop crops that are better equipped to withstand environmental stresses, such as drought and heat. This could lead to more sustainable agricultural practices, reduced crop losses, and a more food-secure future for generations to come.","title":"Unlocking the Secrets of Plant Breeding: A Game-Changing Discovery","link":"http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2024.05.01.591913v1?rss=1","id":"2024.05.01.591913v1","slug":"unlocking-the-secrets-of-plant-breeding-a-game-changing-discovery","creator":"Batista, R.
