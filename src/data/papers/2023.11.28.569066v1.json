{"title":"Unlocking the Secrets of Coca: How Morphometrics and Phylogenomics Can Help Us Understand the Evolution of This Ancient Plant","summary":"Discover how cutting-edge scientific techniques can help us better understand the reticulate evolution of coca, including its domestication and spread throughout South America.","intro":"Get ready to explore the fascinating world of coca, an ancient plant with a rich history and a controversial present. Using morphometrics and phylogenomics, we'll delve into the evolution of this keystone crop and uncover the secrets behind its unique characteristics.","text":"The coca plant has been a vital part of Andean and Amazonian cultures for millennia, but recent global demand for cocaine has led to armed conflict and deforestation. To tackle these issues, it's essential to monitor the expansion and composition of coca plantations. However, current leaf morphology identification methods are inconsistent and fail to reliably distinguish between species and varieties. In this study, we use morphometrics, phylogenomics, and population genomics to analyze the consistency of the current naming system of coca and its four closest wild relatives. Our findings reveal that certain coca varieties exhibit a domestication syndrome and provide insights into the evolution of this ancient plant.","keywords":["coca, evolution, morphometrics, phylogenomics, taxonomy"],"prompt":"a lush, vibrant rainforest, with a hint of a mysterious and exotic atmosphere.
