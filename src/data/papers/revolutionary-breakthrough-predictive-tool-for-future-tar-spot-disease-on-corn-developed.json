{"title":"Revolutionary breakthrough: Predictive tool for future tar spot disease on corn developed!","summary":"Researchers have uncovered the environmental conditions necessary for the development of a yield-limiting disease on corn called tar spot, and developed predictive models to anticipate future tar spot epidemics.","intro":"Get ready for a brighter future for corn farmers! Scientists have made a groundbreaking discovery that could change the way we approach the management of tar spot disease on corn. Using predictive models, this team of researchers has developed a tool that can anticipate and prevent future tar spot epidemics, potentially saving farmers millions in lost yield.
