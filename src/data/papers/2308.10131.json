{"title":"Unmasking Hidden Dissents in FOMC Meetings: A Revolutionary Measurement Model Reveals the True Level of Disagreement","summary":"A new deep learning model has been developed to measure hidden disagreements among members during FOMC meetings. The level of disagreement is found to be driven by current or predicted macroeconomic data, and strongly correlates with monetary policy sub-optimality.","intro":"In a groundbreaking study, researchers have developed a revolutionary deep learning model that measures hidden dissents among members during FOMC meetings. Based on a record of dissents on FOMC votes and transcripts of the meetings from 1976 to 2017, the model uses a self-attention mechanism to create a measure of disagreement for each member in each meeting.","text":"While dissents are rare during FOMC meetings, researchers have found that members often have reservations with the policy decision. The level of disagreement is mostly driven by current or predicted macroeconomic data, suggesting that members may have different views about the future. Using the model to evaluate speeches made by members between meetings, researchers found that the informational content of speeches is low if we can only compare them to speeches made by the chair. However, disagreement strongly correlates with data from the Summary of Economic Projections and a measure of monetary policy sub-optimality, suggesting that disagreement is driven by both members' different preferences and their different views about the future.","keywords":["FOMC","deep learning","disagreement","macroeconomic data","monetary policy"],"prompt":"Generate an image of a group of people sitting around a table, engaged in a heated discussion with graphs and charts depicting macroeconomic data displayed on the walls behind them.","link":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.10131","id":"2308.10131","slug":"unmasking-hidden-dissents-in-fomc-meetings-a-revolutionary-measurement-model-reveals-the-true-level-of-disagreement","creator":"Kwok Ping Tsang, Zichao Yang","topic":"economics"}
