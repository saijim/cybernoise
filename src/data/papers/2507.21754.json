{"title":"From macro to micro: Economic complexity indicators for firm growth","summary":"New research reveals that the real secret to a company’s explosive growth isn’t just selling more products — it’s selling the right ones, in the right places, and branching out the smart way.","intro":"Imagine this: two companies, same size, same industry, same hustle — but one grows 3x faster than the other. Why? The answer isn’t better marketing or luck. It’s in the invisible map of global trade — the hidden patterns of what countries actually produce, and which products are the golden tickets to success. Scientists just cracked the code: the future of your business might depend on one thing you can control — your export choices. And no, you don’t need a PhD to use it.","text":"In a world where tech evolves in seconds and markets shift overnight, one thing remains true: businesses that grow fast aren’t just working harder — they’re working smarter. A groundbreaking new study on 12,852 Italian firms has uncovered a game-changing truth: your company’s future growth depends less on how many products you sell and more on *which* products you sell — and how you spread your wings across the global economy.\n\nHere’s the twist: it’s not just about exporting more. It’s about exporting *better*. The study found that firms selling products that are typically made by the world’s wealthiest nations — think high-tech gadgets, advanced medical devices, or precision engineering tools — consistently outperform their peers. These aren’t just random products. They’re the kind that require deep know-how, advanced infrastructure, and years of innovation. When a company exports these kinds of goods, it’s not just selling a product — it’s signaling that it’s part of the elite club of high-value producers.\n\nBut here’s where it gets even more exciting: the study didn’t stop at what you sell. It also looked at *how* you diversify. And the results are revolutionary. Diversifying *outside* your core business — like a furniture maker branching into smart home sensors — is linked to massive growth. Why? Because stepping into new, complex markets forces your team to learn, adapt, and innovate. It’s like leveling up in a video game — you’re not just surviving, you’re evolving.\n\nOn the flip side, diversifying *within* your core — say, a car manufacturer adding a new type of engine to its existing lineup — actually slows growth. Why? Because it’s like trying to grow by doing the same thing better. It’s safe, but it doesn’t push boundaries. In a fast-moving world, staying in your comfort zone can mean staying behind.\n\nThis discovery led researchers to create a brand-new way of measuring growth potential: in-block vs. out-of-block diversification. Think of it like a digital ecosystem map. The world’s products are grouped into clusters — or ‘blocks’ — based on shared skills, technologies, and supply chains. If your exports are mostly within your block, you’re playing it safe. But if you’re jumping to new blocks — even ones far from your roots — you’re building a future-proof business.\n\nThe data shows it’s not just about ambition. It’s about intelligence. Companies that strategically move into higher-sophistication product blocks, especially those linked to advanced economies, see not just faster growth but also higher profits per employee. That’s efficiency, innovation, and value all wrapped into one.\n\nAnd the best part? This isn’t just for big corporations. Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) — the lifeblood of modern economies — can use these insights too. With tools powered by AI and economic complexity algorithms, even a local startup can now identify which global markets are ripe for entry, which products are rising in value, and which smart diversification moves could double their growth in just a few years.\n\nThis isn’t science fiction. It’s happening now. Governments and innovation hubs are already using these indicators to guide funding, training, and trade policies. The future belongs to companies that don’t just produce — they *think* like global innovators.\n\nSo, what should you do? Start by asking: Are my exports in the high-sophistication blocks? Am I branching into new, complex markets — or just tweaking what I already do? Use data-driven tools to map your product basket. Find your gaps. Make one bold, smart move. Because in today’s economy, growth isn’t about doing more. It’s about doing the *right* things — in the *right* places — with the *right* mindset.\n\nThe future of business isn’t just digital. It’s intelligent, interconnected, and full of opportunity — and it starts with the choices you make today. Your next big leap might not be a new product, but a new destination on the global map.","keywords":["economic complexity","export growth","business innovation","AI-driven strategy","future of work"],"prompt":"A vibrant, futuristic cyberpunk cityscape at night, glowing with neon signs in multiple languages, floating holographic trade maps, and data streams flowing through the air.

Prior theoretical works hinted at the key role of capability accumulation in shaping production activities and performance, without however producing product-level indicators able to forecast corporate growth. Building on economic complexity theory and the corporate growth literature, this paper examines which characteristics of a firm's export basket predict future performance. We analyze a unique longitudinal dataset that covers export and financial data for 12,852 Italian firms. We find that firms exporting products typically exported by wealthier countries -- a proxy for greater product sophistication and market value -- tend to experience higher growth and profit per employee. Moreover, we find that diversification outside of a firm's core production area is positively associated with future growth, whereas diversification within the core is negatively associated. This is revealed by introducing novel measures of in-block and out-of-block diversification, based on algorithmically-detected production blocks. Our findings suggest that growth is driven not just by how many products a firm exports, but also by where these products lie within the production ecosystem, at both local and global scales.","creator":"Valerio De Stefano, Maddalena Mula, Manuel Sebastian Mariani, Andrea Zaccaria","topic":"economics"}
