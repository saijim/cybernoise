{"title":"Revolutionary HDformer Transformer Detects Diabetes with Long Range Vascular Signals","summary":"This paper presents an innovative Transformer-based architecture, the HDformer, which uses long-range photoplethysmography (PPG) signals to detect diabetes with high accuracy and specificity, providing a more scalable and convenient solution compared to traditional invasive methods.","intro":"Say goodbye to invasive detection methods with the breakthrough HDformer - the first transformer to use long-range vascular signals for diabetes detection, providing a non-invasive and accurate solution. The HDformer's Time Square Attention module reduces token volume while retaining local/global dependencies, leading to state-of-the-art performance on the MIMIC-III dataset. Plus, a wearable finger-ring prototype proves its feasibility!
