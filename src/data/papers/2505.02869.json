{"title":"The quest for explosive bubbles in the Indonesian Rupiah/US exchange rate: Does the uncertainty trinity matter?","summary":"A new study reveals the Indonesian Rupiah is prone to explosive fluctuations, and global uncertainty is a major driver.","intro":"Buckle up, investors! The Indonesian Rupiah is a ticking time bomb, with experts warning of repeated crashes and explosive bubbles. But what's behind this chaos, and can anything be done to prevent the next big crash?","text":"In the world of finance, few things are as unpredictable as currency exchange rates. The Indonesian Rupiah, in particular, has a history of wild fluctuations, leaving investors and economists alike scratching their heads. A new study has shed some light on this phenomenon, revealing that the Rupiah is prone to explosive bubbles, and that global uncertainty is a major driver. Using advanced statistical techniques, the researchers analyzed data from January 1985 to September 2023, and found that the Rupiah/US exchange rate has deviated from its fundamental values a staggering six times. This indicates the presence of numerous explosive behaviors, making it a challenging task for investors to predict the currency's movements. But what's causing these explosive bubbles? The study points to the 'uncertainty trinity' - global geopolitical risk, global economic policy uncertainty, and the country's own geopolitical risks - as the main culprits. It found that global geopolitical risk negatively drives explosive actions in the ratio of exchange rates for non-traded and traded goods. In simpler terms, when global tensions rise, the Rupiah becomes more volatile. Similarly, global economic policy uncertainty negatively affects speculative bubbles in the exchange rate and the ratio of exchange rates for non-traded goods. The country's own geopolitical risks, on the other hand, have a negative impact on speculative bubbles in the exchange rate. The study's findings have important implications for investors and policymakers. By understanding the drivers of explosive bubbles, they can take steps to mitigate their impact. For instance, investors can diversify their portfolios to minimize exposure to the Rupiah, while policymakers can implement policies to reduce the currency's volatility. The study's results also highlight the need for a more nuanced approach to managing exchange rates, one that takes into account the complex interplay between global and local factors. As the world becomes increasingly interconnected, understanding the dynamics of currency exchange rates will become more crucial than ever. By shedding light on the Indonesian Rupiah's explosive bubbles, this study provides a valuable roadmap for navigating the complex world of finance. With its findings, investors and policymakers can work together to create a more stable and predictable financial future.","keywords":["Currency Exchange","Explosive Bubbles","Global Uncertainty","Indonesian Rupiah","Financial Stability"],"prompt":"Generate an image of a futuristic cityscape with a giant Indonesian Rupiah coin in the center, surrounded by swirling graphs and charts, in the style of Syd Mead and Ash Thorp, with bold neon colors and a sense of dynamic energy.","id":"2505.02869","slug":"currency-chaos-can-indonesia-escape-the-next-big-crash","link":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02869","abstract":"Abstract: The Generalized Supremum Augmented Dickey-Fuller (GSADF) technique is performed to resolve whether the Indonesian Rupiah/US exchange rate has experienced multiple explosive bubbles. The GSADF uncovers that the Indonesian Rupiah/US exchange rate deviates from the fundamental values by six times from January 1985 to September 2023, periodically indicating the presence of numerous explosive behaviors. Once the full-sample period separates into the managed-floating regime and the free-floating regime, the GSADF still detects multiple bubbles. Of particular curiosity on uncertainty trinity, this study underlines that global geopolitical risk negatively drives explosive actions in the ratio of exchange rates for non-traded and traded goods. The global economic policy uncertainty negatively affects speculative bubbles in the exchange rate and the ratio of exchange rates for non-traded. The country's geopolitical risks negatively strike only speculative bubbles in the exchange rate. Further, we find heterogeneity in our results by examining different exchange rate systems. The robustness checks further firmly ascertain across baseline empirical findings.","creator":"Abdul Khaliq, Syafruddin Karimi, Werry Darta Taifur, Endrizal Ridwan","topic":"economics"}
