One unexpected event can cause a ripple effect, leading to shortages of essential goods and services. But what if we could create supply chains that are virtually indestructible? That's exactly what scientists have achieved in a groundbreaking new study. By analyzing the relationship between upstream sourcing decisions and supply chain survival probability, researchers have developed a new approach that makes supply chains more resilient than ever before. The key to this success lies in understanding how individual agents make decisions under uncertainty and ambiguity. When faced with uncertain events, individuals tend to be risk-averse and ambiguity-averse, which can lead to inefficient decision-making. However, by coordinating downstream firm sourcing decisions at a chain level, supply chains can become much more robust. This means that even if an aggregate shock occurs, part of the upstream suppliers will survive, ensuring that final goods are always available. The researchers also found that diversifying input sources can extract a cost in foregone efficiency, but this is a small price to pay for the increased resilience it brings. The implications of this study are enormous. Imagine a world where your favorite gadgets, food, and medicine are always available, no matter what disasters or conflicts strike. This is no longer science fiction; it's a reality that's within our grasp. With these new insights, companies can start building supply chains that are designed to withstand even the most catastrophic events. The future of logistics has arrived, and it's more resilient than ever before.","title":"Uncertainty of Supply Chains: Risk and Ambiguity","link":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03451","id":"2405.03451","slug":"uncertainty-of-supply-chains-risk-and-ambiguity","creator":"d'Artis Kancs","topic":"economics"}
