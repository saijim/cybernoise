{"title":"Revolutionizing Lupin Farming: Alkaloid Biosynthesis Found in Leaf Epidermis","summary":"Researchers report that the epidermal cells of the leaves are the primary site for the synthesis of toxic alkaloids in narrow-leafed lupin, opening possibilities for the genetic engineering of lupin plants and high-protein lupin seed production.","intro":"Lupin plants, widely considered as promising legume crops, are notorious for accumulating toxic alkaloids in their seeds, a characteristic that limits their use as food. But a recent study reveals that the leaf epidermis is the primary site for the production of these alkaloids, according to laser-capture microdissection and mass spectrometry imaging technologies. This breakthrough sheds light on the alkaloid biosynthesis pathway, with implications for genetic modification of lupin plants and development of high-protein lupin seed production.","keywords":["Lupin farming","Epidermis alkaloid biosynthesis","High-protein lupin seed","Mass spectrometry imaging","Laser-capture microdissection"],"prompt":"An illustration of a field of lupin plants with large, ripe seed pods and a researcher in a lab coat holding a lupin plant.","link":"http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2023.03.20.532575v1?rss=1","id":"328a10d9ff1a4eaa3fa2810df511a8c2","slug":"revolutionizing-lupin-farming-alkaloid-biosynthesis-found-in-leaf-epidermis","imageSlug":"an-illustration-of-a-field-of-lupin-plants-with-large-ripe-seed-pods-and-a-researcher-in-a-lab-coat-holding-a-lupin-plant","creator":"Frick, K.
