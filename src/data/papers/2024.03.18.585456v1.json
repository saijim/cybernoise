However, most of these P450s remain uncharacterized due to the lack of global tools for studying these membrane-resident enzymes.\n\nIn a recent study, scientists have developed an innovative method that combines activity profiling with chemical probes and mass spectrometry identification to discover active P450s in plants, mice, and fungi.\n\nThis groundbreaking research led to the identification of six plant P450s, 40 mouse P450s, and 13 P450s from the wheat pathogen Zymoseptoria tritici. The study further demonstrated that these enzymes could be targeted to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and labeled in a NADPH-dependent manner.\n\nThese findings have opened up exciting opportunities for researchers to study the regulation of cytochrome P450s and discover selective inhibitors. The new method promises to accelerate our understanding of these vital enzymes' functions, paving the way for future breakthroughs in biotechnology and medicine.","title":"Revolutionary Method Identifies Active Cytochrome P450s in Plants, Mice, and Fungi","link":"http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2024.03.18.585456v1?rss=1","id":"2024.03.18.585456v1","slug":"revolutionary-method-identifies-active-cytochrome-p450s-in-plants-mice-and-fungi","creator":"Font Farre, M., Brown, D., Toth, R., Mahadevan, C., Brazier-Hicks, M., Morimoto, K., Kaschani, F., Sinclair, J., Dale, R., Hall, S., Morris, M., Kaiser, M., Wright, A.
