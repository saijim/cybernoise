This study reveals that ethical considerations, like empathy for the receiver, can significantly improve interactions even when faced with nearly independent preferences.","text":"Imagine a future where communication transcends differences in preference, allowing seamless interaction between individuals with varying desires. A new scientific paper brings us one step closer to realizing this vision by exploring the dynamics of communication games in which the sender's preference is influenced by random private idiosyncrasies.\n\nContrary to prior research suggesting that persuasion is impossible within the class of statistically independent sender/receiver preferences, this study uncovers a fascinating truth: robust persuasion may still occur when the sender's preference exhibits only slight state-dependence or idiosyncrasy.\n\nTo achieve this robust communication, the paper introduces the concept of approximating an `acyclic' equilibrium of the transparent preference game. When the sender's preference is connected to this approximated equilibrium—a generalization of partial-pooling equilibria—monotonicity becomes both necessary and sufficient for successful persuasion.\n\nThe study further explores how ethical considerations, such as empathy for the receiver, can enhance or hinder communication. By satisfying a `semi-local' version of increasing differences, the sender's preference can rank pure actions according to a state-independent order, even when mixed actions are involved.\n\nAs we venture further into an era where individual preferences dominate, these groundbreaking findings pave the way for more effective and ethical communication between parties with nearly independent preferences. Embrace this knowledge, and look forward to a future of harmonious coexistence and understanding.","title":"Revolutionizing Communication: Ethical Persuasion in an Era of Nearly Independent Preferences","link":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13983","id":"2403.13983","slug":"revolutionizing-communication-ethical-persuasion-in-an-era-of-nearly-independent-preferences","creator":"Alistair Barton","topic":"economics"}
