However, this study finds that most users consent to being tracked and only a few pay, resulting in an increase in publisher revenue.","intro":"In a groundbreaking move towards greater online freedom, prestigious news publishers are now offering users the choice between paying for privacy or consenting to being tracked. This innovative approach, known as 'pay-or-tracking walls', has raised concerns about whether privacy will become a luxury reserved only for those who can afford it.","text":"The study found that top EU publishers are using pay-or-tracking walls in various ways, including bundling the pay option with advertising-free access or additional content.

Surprisingly, implementing a pay-or-tracking wall does not result in a decline in publisher traffic.","keywords":["pay-or-tracking walls","privacy","publishers","cookie consent banner","revenue"],"prompt":"A futuristic and sleek image of a paywall with two options, one labeled 'Pay for Privacy' and the other 'Consent to Tracking', with users interacting with the wall on a digital device.","link":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03610","id":"2403.03610","slug":"paying-for-privacy-a-new-era-of-online-freedom","creator":"Timo Mueller-Tribbensee, Klaus M.
