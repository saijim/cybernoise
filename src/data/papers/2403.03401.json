Introducing BAIT, a groundbreaking new framework designed to revolutionize the way we compare and implement Machine Learning algorithms in ITP. With its fair and streamlined approach, BAIT makes it easier than ever to assess the performance of different learning methods in ITP.","text":"Artificial Intelligence for Theorem Proving has given rise to a plethora of benchmarks and methodologies, particularly in Interactive Theorem Proving (ITP). However, with so many diverse approaches spread across several ITP systems, it can be challenging to compare methods effectively. This is where BAIT comes in.\n\nDeveloped by a team of experts, BAIT provides a unified perspective for assessing the end-to-end proving performance of systems built on interactive environments. By streamlining the implementation and comparison of Machine Learning algorithms in the ITP context, BAIT aims to be a springboard for future research.\n\nBut that's not all. In a recent demonstration, BAIT was used to compare state-of-the-art architectures applied to the problem of formula embedding across several ITP benchmarks. The results were astounding. Structure Aware Transformers emerged as the top choice, improving on techniques associated with the original problem sets.\n\nSo what does this mean for the future of ITP? With BAIT, we can expect to see more semantically-aware embeddings and improved performance in theorem proving. This is just the beginning of a new era in Interactive Theorem Proving, and we can't wait to see what comes next!","keywords":["BAIT","Interactive Theorem Proving","Machine Learning","Formula Embedding","Structure Aware Transformers"],"prompt":"Revolutionary new framework for Interactive Theorem Proving with Structure Aware Transformers and formula embedding","link":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03401","id":"2403.03401","slug":"bait-unleashes-new-era-in-interactive-theorem-proving","creator":"Sean Lamont, Michael Norrish, Amir Dezfouli, Christian Walder, Paul Montague","topic":"artificial-intelligence"}
