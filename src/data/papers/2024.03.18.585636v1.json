Using a specially designed dCas9-derived tool to remove a key chromatin modification at the CUP SHAPED COTYLEDON 3 (CUC3) organ frontier gene, they successfully removed the trimethyl mark at H3K27. The removal of this mark led to activation of CUC3 expression within its regular territory and ectopically, resulting in alterations in developmental gene expression patterning and sharp consequences on plant morphogenesis and growth.\n\nThis study provides a proof of concept for the effective use of epigenome editing tools in unveiling the causal role of mark dynamics, supported by both molecular and developmental evidences. The findings could have significant implications for our understanding of gene expression and cell fate in plants, paving the way for new approaches to plant breeding and crop improvement.","title":"Revolutionizing Plant Development: Epigenetic Editing with dCas9 Tool Unveils Causal Role of Mark Dynamics","link":"http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2024.03.18.585636v1?rss=1","id":"2024.03.18.585636v1","slug":"revolutionizing-plant-development-epigenetic-editing-with-dcas9-tool-unveils-causal-role-of-mark-dynamics","creator":"Fal, K., Le Masson, M., Berr, A., CARLES, C.
