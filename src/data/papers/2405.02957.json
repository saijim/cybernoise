This is now possible with the creation of Agent Hospital, a groundbreaking simulacrum that's set to revolutionize the way doctors train and perfect their skills. In this virtual hospital, all patients, nurses, and doctors are autonomous agents powered by large language models (LLMs). The central goal of Agent Hospital is to enable doctor agents to learn how to treat illnesses within the simulated environment. To achieve this, researchers have developed a method called MedAgent-Zero. This innovative approach allows doctor agents to accumulate experience from both successful and unsuccessful cases, thanks to the simulacrum's ability to simulate disease onset and progression based on knowledge bases and LLMs. The results are nothing short of astounding. Simulation experiments have shown that the treatment performance of doctor agents consistently improves on various tasks. But what's even more remarkable is that the knowledge acquired by these doctor agents in Agent Hospital can be applied to real-world medicare benchmarks. In fact, after treating around ten thousand patients (a feat that would take a human doctor over two years), the evolved doctor agent achieved an impressive accuracy of 93.06% on a subset of the MedQA dataset that covers major respiratory diseases. This breakthrough paves the way for advancing the applications of LLM-powered agent techniques in medical scenarios. The implications are enormous. With Agent Hospital, doctors can train and perfect their skills without ever putting a real patient's life at risk. Medical errors can be drastically reduced, and patients can receive more effective treatment. It's a future where medicine meets artificial intelligence, and the possibilities are endless!","title":"Revolutionizing Medicine: The Rise of Agent Hospital","link":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02957","id":"2405.02957","slug":"revolutionizing-medicine-the-rise-of-agent-hospital","creator":"Junkai Li, Siyu Wang, Meng Zhang, Weitao Li, Yunghwei Lai, Xinhui Kang, Weizhi Ma, Yang Liu","topic":"artificial-intelligence"}
