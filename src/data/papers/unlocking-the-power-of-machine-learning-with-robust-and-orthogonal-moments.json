{"title":"Unlocking the Power of Machine Learning with Robust and Orthogonal Moments","summary":"This paper presents a novel method for finding locally robust, orthogonal, and debiased moments that can be used to conduct robust inference on parameters of interest in regular semiparametric models.","intro":"Imagine being able to analyze complex systems and make accurate predictions with unprecedented levels of accuracy. That is now possible thanks to the groundbreaking research presented in this paper. By introducing the concept of Restricted Local Non-surjectivity (RLN), we have unlocked the power of machine learning in a way that was never thought possible. In this article, we'll explore how this new method, which does not require identification of parameters or nuisance parameters, can be used to conduct robust inference in a variety of models.","keywords":["machine learning","robust inference","orthogonal moments","semiparametric models","Fisher Information matrix"],"prompt":"a futuristic city with various machines and algorithms working together to create a utopia for humanity.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11418","id":"71f193e2417ffc9f07cf6a42dda39261","slug":"unlocking-the-power-of-machine-learning-with-robust-and-orthogonal-moments","imageSlug":"an-image-of-a-futuristic-city-with-various-machines-and-algorithms-working-together-to-create-a-utopia-for-humanity","creator":"Facundo Arga&#xf1;araz, Juan Carlos Escanciano"}
