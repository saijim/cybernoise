{"intro":"Imagine a world where you have a say in how your city's budget is allocated, with a simple and intuitive voting system that lets you express your preferences. That's the future of participatory budgeting (PB), and it's closer than you think! A new study has explored how different voting input and aggregation rules can impact voter behavior and perceptions of fairness and legitimacy in PB. The results offer actionable insights for digital governance, paving the way for more transparent and participatory urban decision-making.","keywords":["participatory budgeting","digital platforms","voting input formats","fairness","legitimacy"],"prompt":"A futuristic cityscape with citizens using digital devices to vote on urban projects in a participatory budgeting process, with various voting input and aggregation options displayed on the screen.","summary":"New study explores how different voting rules impact behavior and perceptions of fairness in participatory budgeting","text":"Participatory Budgeting (PB) is an innovative democratic instrument that empowers citizens to directly propose and vote on urban projects, with digital platforms now enabling cities to implement PB processes at scale. However, the design choices made by cities in terms of voting rules can greatly impact voter behavior and perceptions of fairness and legitimacy.\n\nTo address this challenge, a new study has explored how different voting input and aggregation rules can influence voter behavior and perceptions in PB. The study presented participants with a fictional PB setting and asked them to vote under various conditions.\n\nThe results showed that participants preferred voting input formats that are more expressive, such as rankings and distributing points, over simpler formats like approval voting. Participants also indicated a desire for the budget to be fairly distributed across city districts and project categories.\n\nMoreover, participants found the Method of Equal Shares voting rule to be fairer than the conventional Greedy voting rule. These findings offer valuable insights for digital governance, contributing to the development of fairer and more transparent digital systems and collective decision-making processes for citizens.","title":"Designing Fair and Legitimate Digital Voting Systems for Participatory Budgeting: A New Study Explores How Different Rules Impact Behavior and Perceptions","link":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03501","id":"2310.03501","slug":"designing-fair-and-legitimate-digital-voting-systems-for-participatory-budgeting-a-new-study-explores-how-different-rules-impact-behavior-and-perceptions","creator":"Joshua C.
