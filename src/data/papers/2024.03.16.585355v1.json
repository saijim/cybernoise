In a new study, scientists have discovered how to predict these emissions by studying the microscale distribution of organic matter in the soil matrix.\n\nDenitrification is a key process in soil nitrogen cycling, where denitrifiers use nitrate as an alternative electron acceptor. This process occurs predominantly within microbial hotspots, but until now, it has been difficult to accurately quantify these hotspots.\n\nUsing a unique combination of X-ray CT imaging, microscale O2 measurements, and 15N labeling, scientists were able to analyze the dynamics of GHG fluxes, soil oxygen supply, and the distribution of particulate organic matter (POM) in intact soil samples from a grassland and a cropland under different moisture conditions.\n\nTheir findings reveal that both free and occluded POM contribute to GHG emissions. However, it is the occluded POM – i.e., POM at distant locations to air-filled pores – that emerged as a primary driver of denitrification within structured soils of both land uses.\n\nThis means that despite possessing compacted areas that could favor denitrification, the cropland had only small amounts of occluded POM to stimulate denitrification. In contrast, the grassland had higher contents of occluded POM, leading to higher denitrification rates.\n\nThese findings underline the complex interaction between soil structural heterogeneity, organic carbon supply, and microbial hotspot formation. By incorporating the microscale distribution of POM into predictive models for soil denitrification and N2O emissions, scientists can better understand soil-related GHG emissions.\n\nThis breakthrough has huge implications for our understanding of climate change and could pave the way for more accurate predictions of GHG emissions from soil.","title":"Unlocking the Secrets of Soil: How to Predict Greenhouse Gas Emissions","link":"http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2024.03.16.585355v1?rss=1","id":"2024.03.16.585355v1","slug":"unlocking-the-secrets-of-soil-how-to-predict-greenhouse-gas-emissions","creator":"Lucas, M., Rohe, L., Apelt, B., Stange, C.
