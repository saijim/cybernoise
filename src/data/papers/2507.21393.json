{"title":"Cash and Cognition: The Impact of Transfer Timing on Standardized Test Performance and Human Capital","summary":"New research reveals that giving low-income families cash just days before a big exam can boost student test scores—by a surprising amount—and lead to better college outcomes down the road.","intro":"Imagine a single, simple tweak—timing your paycheck right before a big test—could help a student ace their exam, dream bigger, and land a better future. Scientists just found that when low-income families get their cash transfer just days before a high-stakes test, their kids score higher, work harder on tough questions, and end up more likely to go to college—and stay in it. And the best part? It’s not magic. It’s math. And it’s already working in real life.","text":"In a groundbreaking study involving over 185,000 high school students across the globe, researchers uncovered a surprising truth: when money arrives just before a major exam, students perform better—not by a little, but by a meaningful 0.01 standard deviation. That might sound small, but in education, even tiny gains can change lives. Think of it like giving a student a mental boost before a marathon: the right fuel at the right time makes all the difference.\n\nThe study focused on the world’s largest conditional cash transfer program, where families receive money for keeping their kids in school and attending health checkups. But here’s the twist: the timing of when that money arrives mattered more than anyone thought. Students who got their transfer just a few days before a college entrance exam scored higher—especially on the final, most challenging questions. Why? Because they had the mental stamina to keep going, and the confidence to push through.\n\nEven more exciting? The boost wasn’t just temporary. Kids who got their cash earlier relative to the test didn’t just do better on that one exam—they stayed in college longer, graduated more often, and landed formal jobs seven years later. That’s the power of a little financial breathing room at the right moment.\n\nThe researchers dug deeper, analyzing every single question on the test. They found the biggest gains came on easier questions and the last ones—those that require focus and endurance. That tells us something profound: it’s not about smarter kids. It’s about kids who aren’t stressed out by hunger, bills, or anxiety. When they’re not scrambling for basics, they can focus on what matters—learning.\n\nAnd the impact was biggest for families receiving larger transfers. More money, delivered at the right time, meant more confidence, more effort, and more future success. This isn’t just about test scores—it’s about breaking the cycle of poverty one smart payment at a time.\n\nThe implications? Huge. Imagine if every student in need got their scholarship or grant check a week before exams. Or if government programs adjusted payment schedules to align with test dates. It’s not about giving more money—it’s about giving it at the right time. A tiny change in logistics could unlock massive gains in human potential.\n\nThis isn’t science fiction. It’s already happening in places like Mexico, Brazil, and Kenya, where cash transfer programs are proving that money, when timed right, doesn’t just ease stress—it builds futures. And the best part? It’s affordable. It’s simple. It’s scalable.\n\nSo the next time you think about how to help a student succeed, don’t just hand them a textbook or a mentor. Think about timing. Because sometimes, the most powerful tool isn’t knowledge—it’s peace of mind. And when that peace comes with a little cash, just in time, it can change everything.","keywords":["cash transfer","student performance","test timing","human capital","future success"],"prompt":"A vibrant, optimistic cyberpunk cityscape at dawn, with glowing holographic school signs floating above futuristic high schools.

We combine administrative records from the world's largest conditional cash transfer program with college admission exam results of 185,000 high school students from beneficiary families. Exploiting random variation in payment dates, we find that receiving the transfer in the days preceding the exam increases test scores by 0.01 standard deviations relative to receiving it the subsequent week. Question-level analysis reveals that effects are concentrated in final questions and easier questions, suggesting improved cognitive endurance and effort allocation. The impacts are largest for recipients of larger transfers, who experience persistent gains in human capital accumulation: their college enrollment increases by 0.6 percentage points, with higher graduation and formal employment rates seven years later. Our findings show that short-term liquidity constraints during high-stakes events can have long-lasting implications, and suggest opportunities to improve social programs through improved payment scheduling.","creator":"Axel Eizmendi Larrinaga, Germ\\'an Reyes","topic":"economics"}
