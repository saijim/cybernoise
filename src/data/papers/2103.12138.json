{"title":"The Future is Prosocial: Harnessing Shareholder Power for Global Good","summary":"Riding the wave of after-effects from corporate Annual General Meetings (AGMs), shareholders are steering corporations towards more prosocial actions, even when they are costly.","intro":"Discover how maverick shareholders are transforming corporate landscapes, leading the way for firm commitments to societal good, all while expecting a slight dip in earnings!","text":"Imagine a world where corporations use their power not solely for profit, but also for prosocial actions. This is not a fictional future, but rather, a surprising side-effect from corporations' Annual General Meetings, commonly known as AGMs. With the increased media exposure that AGMs bring, shareholders synonymous with the corporation start showing their support for prosocial changes, even if they come with a certain financial cost. This fascinating shift in corporate outlook transcends profit margins and shareholder dividends and marks a pivotal moment in our society's evolution.\n\nOur careful study illuminates this trend beautifully. The model, developed after meticulously observing the ebb and flow of post-AGM corporate actions over the last decade, is specifically designed to analyze and predict the impact of shareholder sentiments on the firm's prosocial decisions. We took quintessential instances of prosocial activities, like covid-related donations and private sanctions on Russia, as our primary samples of study.\n\nThe conclusions drawn from our decade-long data are a testament to how drastically shareholder influence can shape a corporation's decisions. Firms connected with individuals strived to earn public goodwill by advocating for and implementing costly prosocial decisions. On the other hand, financial corporations displayed their opposition, suggesting a dichotomy of influences within the corporate environment.\n\nDespite this divergence in preferences, the firms went ahead reflecting the values of their close-kin shareholders, and interestingly, the repercussions were far from catastrophic. There was a minor dip in earnings by about 3% – a small price to pay for societal goodwill and tangible benefits, perhaps.\n\nThe takeaway is this – inclusive and ethical choices by firms can lead to a broader societal impact, even if it means moderate economic costs. Additionally, the presence of major shareholders with diverse preferences can prevent steep distributional costs. This paves the way for more nuanced conversations around the shared cost of pursuing value versus societal goodwill.\n\nIn this futuristic world of ours, the 'shareholder' is becoming the 'stakeholder', and the corporations aren't just pursuing value, they're pursuing values. Together, we're striving to balance the scales of profit, preference, and prosocial actions, all empowered by the drivers of the future - individual shareholders.","keywords":["corporate responsibility","prosocial-actions","shareholders","Annual General Meetings","corporate performance"],"prompt":"a dystopian cityscape transforming into a green utopia with major corporate buildings displaying banners promoting prosocial messages","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.12138","id":"2103.12138","slug":"the-future-is-prosocial-harnessing-shareholder-power-for-global-good","creator":"Michele Fioretti, Victor Saint-Jean, Simon C.
