{"title":"Future of Fiscal Policy: The Economic Alchemy of Public Debt","summary":"Discover how the balancing act of public debt and government spending can shape and drive economic growth.","intro":"Are our governments on the edge of unlocking a golden era of economic boom with the right use of public debt? Find out in this riveting expos√©!","text":"In a world hungry for economic growth, the wellbeing of nations rests on the shoulders of the fiscal policy. The delicate dance between public debt and government spending lies at the heart of this intrigue. Using historical data from the United States, we delve into the hidden mechanisms that can transform public debt into a catalyst for progress. \n\nWhen public debt becomes a considerable burden, governments respond by restraining the issuance of further debt. Paradoxically, this initial shock leads to a modest increase in public spending in the short-term, and can even whip up a surprising reversal of spending in the longer term. Is this the secret formula to stimulating economic activity? \n\nShockingly, the opposite is true. The government intentionally curbs its powers to take more loans, thereby maintaining the sustainability of public debt. This intriguing move is not a mishap, but a strategic decision. By limiting its own borrowing powers, the government ensures that it can fulfil its debt obligations, such as repaying principal and interest amounts on time. This action is a powerful tool for economic survival in the long run. \n\nThe more sustainable the public debt is, the more room the government has to manoeuvre without unexpectedly choking off economic activity. Optimising debt and spending proportions unlocks a new potential for driving economic growth, turning once burdensome debt into a well-managed resource. \n\nThese revelations remain robust, despite the analysis strategies employed. Thus, the optimal use of debt acts like a golden ticket, boosting the economy and fuelling sustainable growth. With these insights, we can expect a future where public debt can be harnessed effectively to drive unprecedented economic development. The dome of financial burden may well be lifting and heralding a new dawn of economic prosperity.","keywords":["Fiscal Policy","Public Debt","Government Spending","Economic Growth","Debt Sustainability"],"prompt":"Illustration of a balance scale balancing public debt and government spending with a thriving cityscape in the background.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07371","id":"2309.07371","slug":"future-of-fiscal-policy-the-economic-alchemy-of-public-debt","creator":"Venance Riblier","topic":"economics"}
