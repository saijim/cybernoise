{"title":"Transformative Agreements: How Open Access Deals Might Boost Big Publishers","summary":"A new study finds that 'publish-and-read' deals between universities and publishers could strengthen market power for big academic journal owners, despite their intentions.","intro":"As the world moves towards open access for academic research, a new study suggests that some of the most popular deal structures might actually be bolstering the market power of large publishing houses. Here's what you need to know.","text":"Academic journals are often considered 'must stock' products due to their high relevance and impact on research. This gives commercial owners extraordinary market power, which can make it difficult for new competitors to enter the market. In an effort to address this issue, university consortia around the world have been negotiating so-called 'transformative agreements' with many publishing houses. These agreements are intended to pave the way towards standard open-access publishing.\n\nOne popular contract design for these transformative agreements is the 'publish-and-read' (PAR) scheme. Under this model, publishers are paid a fixed case-by-case rate for each publication, which includes a fee for their extensive libraries. In turn, all subscription payments are waived. The idea behind this model is to create an entirely open access environment, where researchers can access and publish academic research without having to pay expensive subscription fees.\n\nHowever, a new study suggests that the PAR fee contract design of transformative agreements might actually be raising entry barriers for new (open-access) competitors even further, rather than lowering costs for universities, their libraries, and taxpayers as intended. The study found that this contract design benefits the included publishers regardless of whether the number of publications in these publishers' journals grows or declines.\n\nThe reason for this is that the PAR model provides a stable revenue stream for publishers, while also allowing them to maintain control over their extensive libraries and intellectual property. This can make it difficult for new competitors to break into the market and offer alternative publishing options for researchers.\n\nDespite these concerns, transformative agreements are still an important step towards open access in academic research. However, it's clear that more needs to be done to ensure that these deals are truly benefiting researchers, universities, and taxpayers, rather than simply bolstering the market power of large publishing houses.","keywords":["transformative agreements","publish-and-read (PAR)","open access","academic journals","market power"],"prompt":"A digital image of a futuristic city skyline with a large academic journal publisher's logo prominently displayed in the foreground.
