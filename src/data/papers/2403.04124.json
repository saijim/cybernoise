However, these powerful tools also raise legitimate concerns about user privacy. A recent study has uncovered a crucial factor that governs the trade-off between privacy and generalization in differentially private (DP) trained models: flatness of the loss landscape. The researchers propose an innovative framework called DP-Flat, which significantly improves model generalization while preserving privacy.","text":"Large Language Models (LLMs) have become a cornerstone of modern AI research, demonstrating remarkable abilities in natural language processing tasks such as translation, summarization, and question answering. Despite their potential, LLMs pose significant privacy risks due to the sensitive nature of the data used for training. Differential Privacy (DP) techniques have emerged as a promising solution, but they often compromise generalization performance. The new study reveals that the flatness of DP-trained models' loss landscape is an essential element in striking the right balance between privacy and generalization.\n\nThe researchers propose a comprehensive framework called DP-Flat, which operates at three coarse-to-grained levels to enhance model generalization while preserving DP characteristics. The first level involves perturbation-aware min-max optimization on model weights within a layer, followed by flatness-guided sparse prefix-tuning on weights across layers. Finally, the framework employs weight knowledge distillation between DP and non-DP copies of weights to further improve performance.\n\nExperiments conducted in both black-box and white-box scenarios demonstrate that DP-Flat outperforms existing techniques in enhancing generalization and maintaining DP characteristics. For instance, on the text classification dataset QNLI, DP-Flat achieves similar performance to non-private full fine-tuning under a privacy budget of $Îµ=3$, and even better performance with higher privacy budgets.","keywords":["privacy","large language models","differential privacy","flatness","generalization"],"prompt":"A cyberpunk illustration of a large, glowing brain made up of interconnected nodes and lines, hovering in the background with futuristic cityscape.
