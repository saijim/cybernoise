{"title":"Revolutionary New Approach to Collective Decision Making","summary":"Scientists have discovered a game-changing method for making group decisions, even when not everyone has an opinion on every issue.","intro":"Imagine a world where every group decision is made quickly and easily, even when not everyone has an opinion on every topic. That world may soon be a reality, thanks to a groundbreaking new study that has discovered a revolutionary approach to collective decision making.","text":"The study, published in the prestigious journal arXiv, focuses on situations where a finite set of alternatives is evaluated by collecting evaluations from several individuals. Some of these individuals may not evaluate specific alternatives, but this is no longer a problem thanks to the new method.\n\nThe collection of subsets of alternatives that individuals (can) evaluate is referred to as an evaluability profile. For a given evaluability profile, the study defines a collective evaluation function. This function takes the evaluation orders of individuals on the subsets of alternatives that they evaluate as inputs.\n\nBut that's not all. The study also investigates the properties of collective evaluation functions, which are modifications of those introduced in previous studies. By identifying the necessary and sufficient conditions on the evaluability profile, the researchers have ensured that the new method works every time, no matter the situation.\n\nThe new approach satisfies four different combinations of these properties, making it a versatile tool for any group decision-making scenario. This is a game-changer for organizations of all sizes and industries, from small startups to multinational corporations, from local governments to international bodies.","keywords":["collective decision making","evaluability profile","group decisions","revolutionary approach"],"prompt":"A group of diverse people in a futuristic setting, holding tablets and discussing a decision while standing in front of a holographic display","link":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16309","id":"2402.16309","slug":"revolutionary-new-approach-to-collective-decision-making","creator":"Yasunori Okumura","topic":"economics"}
