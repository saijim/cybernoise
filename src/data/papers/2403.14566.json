The objective is to make DNNs more interpretable and comprehensible to humans by explaining decisions in terms of human-understandable concepts, a crucial step towards creating trustworthy AI systems.\n\nThe authors provide an insightful taxonomy of various concept representation methods and automatic concept discovery algorithms used in the field. They also delve into the application of these approaches for ante-hoc training and post-hoc model disentanglement evaluation.\n\nConcepts, as human interpretable units of data, play a pivotal role in this research area. By utilizing concepts to explain DNN decisions, researchers can detect spurious correlations, inherent biases, or clever-hans tendencies.\n\nWith the rapid development of XAI techniques and concept-based approaches, there is a growing need for a systematic review summarizing recent advancements. This study addresses this need by offering an in-depth analysis of existing methods and their potential applications.\n\nDespite being a relatively new field with numerous representations emerging continuously, limited work has been done on Concept-based Model improvement. The authors aim to bridge this gap by surveying the concept-based model improvement methods, making this study a valuable resource for both researchers and practitioners in the XAI community.","title":"The Future of Interpretable AI: A Comprehensive Review of Concept-Based Approaches for Model Improvement","link":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14566","id":"2403.14566","slug":"the-future-of-interpretable-ai-a-comprehensive-review-of-concept-based-approaches-for-model-improvement","creator":"Avani Gupta, P J Narayanan","topic":"artificial-intelligence"}
