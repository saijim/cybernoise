  "intro": "Climate change poses a significant threat to global food security, but fear not! Scientists have unearthed a groundbreaking solution in the form of rice landraces native to North-Eastern India. These landraces possess remarkable resilience to high temperatures and elevated CO2 levels, offering hope for a sustainable and bountiful future.",
  "text": "Rice, a staple cereal consumed worldwide, has a rich history of domestication and cultivation. Among its origins is India, particularly the North-Eastern region, which harbors an array of landraces capable of withstanding the adverse effects brought about by climate change. In an ambitious endeavor, researchers set out to evaluate the potential of these North-Eastern Indian rice landraces to thrive in challenging environmental conditions characterized by high temperatures and elevated CO2 levels.\n\nThe study commenced with an initial experiment involving 75 rice landraces to assess their ability to tolerate high heat. From these, seven exceptional performers, along with a reference variety (N22), were selected and subjected to further evaluation across two years under different treatment conditions: control, mild stress, and severe stress. The mild stress treatment consisted of elevated CO2 levels (550 ppm) and an increase of 4 degrees Celsius above ambient temperature, while the severe stress treatment entailed even higher CO2 levels (750 ppm) and a 6-degree Celsius temperature rise, both simulated using advanced bioreactors. Phenological, morphological, physiological, and yield-related parameters were meticulously examined to gauge the landraces' performance.\n\nThe results were nothing short of groundbreaking: under mild stress conditions, the landraces exhibited remarkable resilience and displayed positive effects on various morpho-physiological parameters such as plant height, leaf number, leaf area, and yield-related traits including spikelets per panicle, thousand-grain weight, and grain yield. This boost in performance could be attributed to the landraces' capacity to maintain higher photosynthetic rates and possess superior tolerance to moderately high temperatures.\n\nHowever, as temperatures soared under severe stress conditions, all genotypes, including the landraces, experienced a significant decline in the studied parameters, including grain yield. Nevertheless, crucial correlations emerged, highlighting the significance of pollen traits in ensuring spikelet fertility at maturity, which in turn contributed significantly to grain yield under stressful conditions. The study also shed light on the positive impact of physiological traits, particularly shoot biomass, on crucial yield-related parameters such as spikelets per panicle, harvest index, thousand-grain weight, and grain yield.\n\nOut of all the examined landraces, two shining stars emerged: Kohima Special and Lisem showcased exceptional responsiveness compared to other landraces and even outperformed the reference variety, N22, in stress conditions. The utilization of Start Codon Targeted (SCoT) markers revealed a total of 77 alleles, with an impressive 55 displaying polymorphism. The presence of genetic variation among the tested rice lines further confirmed the closely related nature of Kohima Special and Lisem. These two landraces hold immense promise as valuable pre-breeding materials for future rice breeding endeavors, specifically aimed at enhancing stress tolerance properties, particularly in high-temperature and elevated CO2 environments prevalent in the ever-changing climate of our future.\n\nThe revolutionary findings from this study provide a ray of hope amidst the concerning climate change scenario. By harnessing the genetic potential of North-Eastern Indian rice landraces, we can pave the way for sustainable food production in the face of increasing temperatures and rising CO2 levels. With these resilient landraces at our disposal, we are well-equipped to tackle the challenges of tomorrow and ensure a prosperous, high-tech future of abundant food for all.\n\nKeywords: rice landraces, high temperature stress, elevated CO2 levels, phenological traits, yield-associated parameters",
