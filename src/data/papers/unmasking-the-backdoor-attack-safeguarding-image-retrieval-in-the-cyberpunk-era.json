  "summary": "A cutting-edge defense mechanism, the confusing perturbations-induced backdoor attack (CIBA), is created to protect deep hashing models from cyber attacks that manipulate search results through the injection of poisoned data.",
  "intro": "In a world where images hold immense power, safeguarding their integrity and accuracy is of paramount importance. The rise of deep hashing models for image retrieval has revolutionized the way we search for visual information. However, this progress is not without its vulnerabilities. Among the most concerning threats is the backdoor attack, a malicious technique that can tamper with the search results to manipulate our perception of reality. But fear not, cyberpunk warriors, as a group of forward-thinking researchers have developed an ingenious defense mechanism known as the confusing perturbations-induced backdoor attack (CIBA) to combat this sinister plot.",
  "text": "In the battle against backdoor attacks on hash-based image retrieval, the CIBA defense mechanism emerges as a formidable shield. Traditional backdoor attacks involve injecting a small number of poisoned images into the training data, effectively corrupting the model's learning process. However, these attacks often leave detectable traces, making it easier for vigilant defenders to identify and mitigate them. To circumvent this, the CIBA approach takes a different path. Instead of introducing blatantly malicious data, it leverages confusing perturbations to subtly disrupt the hashing code learning process. These perturbations, meticulously designed to be imperceptible to the human eye, optimize the intra-class dispersion and inter-class shift in the Hamming space. By cautiously manipulating the model's perception of similarity between images, the attackers lay the groundwork for their malevolent plans.",
