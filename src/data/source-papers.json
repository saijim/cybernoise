        "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11337",
        "abstract": "Federated learning has gained popularity as a solution to data availability and privacy challenges in machine learning. However, the aggregation process of local model updates to obtain a global model in federated learning is susceptible to malicious attacks, such as backdoor poisoning, label-flipping, and membership inference. Malicious users aim to sabotage the collaborative learning process by training the local model with malicious data. In this paper, we propose a novel robust aggregation approach based on recursive Euclidean distance calculation. Our approach measures the distance of the local models from the previous global model and assigns weights accordingly. Local models far away from the global model are assigned smaller weights to minimize the data poisoning effect during aggregation. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms by at least $5\\%$ in accuracy while reducing time complexity by less than $55\\%$. Our contribution is significant as it addresses the critical issue of malicious attacks in federated learning while improving the accuracy of the global model.",

        "abstract": "Latest federated learning (FL) methods started to focus on how to use unlabeled data in clients for training due to users' privacy concerns, high labeling costs, or lack of expertise. However, current Federated Semi-Supervised/Self-Supervised Learning (FSSL) approaches fail to learn large-scale images because of the limited computing resources of local clients. In this paper, we introduce a new framework FedMAE, which stands for Federated Masked AutoEncoder, to address the problem of how to utilize unlabeled large-scale images for FL. Specifically, FedMAE can pre-train one-block Masked AutoEncoder (MAE) using large images in lightweight client devices, and then cascades multiple pre-trained one-block MAEs in the server to build a multi-block ViT backbone for downstream tasks. Theoretical analysis and experimental results on image reconstruction and classification show that our FedMAE achieves superior performance compared to the state-of-the-art FSSL methods.",

        "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11340",
        "abstract": "Diabetes mellitus is a worldwide concern, and early detection can help to prevent serious complications. Low-cost, non-invasive detection methods, which take cardiovascular signals into deep learning models, have emerged. However, limited accuracy constrains their clinical usage. In this paper, we present a new Transformer-based architecture, Higher Dimensional Transformer (HDformer), which takes long-range photoplethysmography (PPG) signals to detect diabetes. The long-range PPG contains broader and deeper signal contextual information compared to the less-than-one-minute PPG signals commonly utilized in existing research. To increase the capability and efficiency of processing the long range data, we propose a new attention module Time Square Attention (TSA), reducing the volume of the tokens by more than 10x, while retaining the local/global dependencies. It converts the 1-dimensional inputs into 2-dimensional representations and groups adjacent points into a single 2D token, using the 2D Transformer models as the backbone of the encoder. It generates the dynamic patch sizes into a gated mixture-of-experts (MoE) network as decoder, which optimizes the learning on different attention areas. Extensive experimentations show that HDformer results in the state-of-the-art performance (sensitivity 98.4, accuracy 97.3, specificity 92.8, and AUC 0.929) on the standard MIMIC-III dataset, surpassing existing studies. This work is the first time to take long-range, non-invasive PPG signals via Transformer for diabetes detection, achieving a more scalable and convenient solution compared to traditional invasive approaches. The proposed HDformer can also be scaled to analyze general long-range biomedical waveforms. A wearable prototype finger-ring is designed as a proof of concept.",

        "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11341",
        "abstract": "As advanced machine learning systems' capabilities begin to play a significant role in geopolitics and societal order, it may become imperative that (1) governments be able to enforce rules on the development of advanced ML systems within their borders, and (2) countries be able to verify each other's compliance with potential future international agreements on advanced ML development. This work analyzes one mechanism to achieve this, by monitoring the computing hardware used for large-scale NN training. The framework's primary goal is to provide governments high confidence that no actor uses large quantities of specialized ML chips to execute a training run in violation of agreed rules. At the same time, the system does not curtail the use of consumer computing devices, and maintains the privacy and confidentiality of ML practitioners' models, data, and hyperparameters. The system consists of interventions at three stages: (1) using on-chip firmware to occasionally save snapshots of the the neural network weights stored in device memory, in a form that an inspector could later retrieve; (2) saving sufficient information about each training run to prove to inspectors the details of the training run that had resulted in the snapshotted weights; and (3) monitoring the chip supply chain to ensure that no actor can avoid discovery by amassing a large quantity of un-tracked chips. The proposed design decomposes the ML training rule verification problem into a series of narrow technical challenges, including a new variant of the Proof-of-Learning problem [Jia et al. '21].",

        "abstract": "Recent advancements in decision-making large language model (LLM) agents have demonstrated impressive performance across various benchmarks. However, these state-of-the-art approaches typically necessitate internal model fine-tuning, external model fine-tuning, or policy optimization over a defined state space. Implementing these methods can prove challenging due to the scarcity of high-quality training data or the lack of well-defined state space. Moreover, these agents do not possess certain qualities inherent to human decision-making processes, specifically the ability to learn from mistakes. Self-reflection allows humans to efficiently solve novel problems through a process of trial and error. Building on recent research, we propose Reflexion, an approach that endows an agent with dynamic memory and self-reflection capabilities to enhance its existing reasoning trace and task-specific action choice abilities. To achieve full automation, we introduce a straightforward yet effective heuristic that enables the agent to pinpoint hallucination instances, avoid repetition in action sequences, and, in some environments, construct an internal memory map of the given environment. To assess our approach, we evaluate the agent's ability to complete decision-making tasks in AlfWorld environments and knowledge-intensive, search-based question-and-answer tasks in HotPotQA environments. We observe success rates of 97% and 51%, respectively, and provide a discussion on the emergent property of self-reflection.",

We first propose an Informed Posterior Sampling-based RL (iPSRL) algorithm that uses the offline dataset, and information about the expert's behavioral policy used to generate the offline dataset. Its cumulative Bayesian regret goes down to zero exponentially fast in N, the offline dataset size if the expert is competent enough. Since this algorithm is computationally impractical, we then propose the iRLSVI algorithm that can be seen as a combination of the RLSVI algorithm for online RL, and imitation learning. Our empirical results show that the proposed iRLSVI algorithm is able to achieve significant reduction in regret as compared to two baselines: no offline data, and offline dataset but used without information about the generative policy. Our algorithm bridges online RL and imitation learning for the first time.",

Worse, the representations of these entities are unknown and must be inferred from sensory percepts. We present a hierarchical abstraction approach to uncover these underlying entities and achieve combinatorial generalization from unstructured visual inputs. By constructing a factorized transition graph over clusters of entity representations inferred from pixels, we show how to learn a correspondence between intervening on states of entities in the agent's model and acting on objects in the environment. We use this correspondence to develop a method for control that generalizes to different numbers and configurations of objects, which outperforms current offline deep RL methods when evaluated on simulated rearrangement tasks.",

        "abstract": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have enjoyed wide spread applications in graph-structured data. However, existing graph based applications commonly lack annotated data. GNNs are required to learn latent patterns from a limited amount of training data to perform inferences on a vast amount of test data. The increased complexity of GNNs, as well as a single point of model parameter initialization, usually lead to overfitting and sub-optimal performance. In addition, it is known that GNNs are vulnerable to adversarial attacks. In this paper, we push one step forward on the ensemble learning of GNNs with improved accuracy, generalization, and adversarial robustness. Following the principles of stochastic modeling, we propose a new method called GNN-Ensemble to construct an ensemble of random decision graph neural networks whose capacity can be arbitrarily expanded for improvement in performance. The essence of the method is to build multiple GNNs in randomly selected substructures in the topological space and subfeatures in the feature space, and then combine them for final decision making. These GNNs in different substructure and subfeature spaces generalize their classification in complementary ways. Consequently, their combined classification performance can be improved and overfitting on the training data can be effectively reduced. In the meantime, we show that GNN-Ensemble can significantly improve the adversarial robustness against attacks on GNNs.",

Given the kitchen boundary, counters, and recipes, the proposed method computes the optimal placement of counters that meet the requirement of kitchen design rules and improve Human-Robot collaboration. The key technical challenge is that the optimization method usually evaluates thousands of designs and the computational cost of motion planning, which is part of the evaluation function, is expensive.

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as potent tools increasingly capable of performing human-level tasks. The recent development in the form of GPT-4 and its demonstrated success in tasks complex to humans such as medical exam, bar exam and others has led to an increased confidence in the LLMs to become perfect instruments of intelligence. Though, the GPT-4 paper has shown performance on some common sense reasoning tasks, a comprehensive assessment of GPT-4 on common sense reasoning tasks, particularly on the existing well-established datasets is missing. In this study, we focus on the evaluation of GPT-4's performance on a set of common sense reasoning questions from the widely used CommonsenseQA dataset along with tools from cognitive psychology. In doing so, we understand how GPT-4 processes and integrates common sense knowledge with contextual information, providing insight into the underlying cognitive processes that enable its ability to generate common sense responses. We show that GPT-4 exhibits a high level of accuracy in answering common sense questions, outperforming its predecessor, GPT-3 and GPT-3.5. We show that the accuracy of GPT-4 on CommonSenseQA is 83 % and it has been shown in the original study that human accuracy over the same data was 89 %. Although, GPT-4 falls short of the human performance, it is a substantial improvement from the original 56.5 % in the original language model used by the CommonSenseQA study. Our results strengthen the already available assessments and confidence on GPT-4's common sense reasoning abilities which have significant potential to revolutionize the field of AI, by enabling machines to bridge the gap between human and machine reasoning.",

        "abstract": "The problem of minimizing finite fuzzy interpretations in fuzzy description logics (FDLs) is worth studying. For example, the structure of a fuzzy/weighted social network can be treated as a fuzzy interpretation in FDLs, where actors are individuals and actions are roles. Minimizing the structure of a fuzzy/weighted social network makes it more compact, thus making network analysis tasks more efficient. In this work, we study the problem of minimizing a finite fuzzy interpretation in a FDL by using the largest crisp auto-bisimulation. The considered FDLs use the Baaz projection operator and their semantics is specified using an abstract algebra of fuzzy truth values, which can be any linear and complete residuated lattice. We provide an efficient algorithm with a complexity of $O((m \\log{l} + n) \\log{n})$ for minimizing a given finite fuzzy interpretation $\\mathcal{I}$, where $n$ is the size of the domain of $\\mathcal{I}$, $m$ is number of nonzero instances of atomic roles of $\\mathcal{I}$ and $l$ is the number of different fuzzy values used for instances of atomic roles of $\\mathcal{I}$.

        "abstract": "The huge supporting training data on the Internet has been a key factor in the success of deep learning models. However, this abundance of public-available data also raises concerns about the unauthorized exploitation of datasets for commercial purposes, which is forbidden by dataset licenses. In this paper, we propose a backdoor-based watermarking approach that serves as a general framework for safeguarding public-available data. By inserting a small number of watermarking samples into the dataset, our approach enables the learning model to implicitly learn a secret function set by defenders. This hidden function can then be used as a watermark to track down third-party models that use the dataset illegally. Unfortunately, existing backdoor insertion methods often entail adding arbitrary and mislabeled data to the training set, leading to a significant drop in performance and easy detection by anomaly detection algorithms. To overcome this challenge, we introduce a clean-label backdoor watermarking framework that uses imperceptible perturbations to replace mislabeled samples. As a result, the watermarking samples remain consistent with the original labels, making them difficult to detect. Our experiments on text, image, and audio datasets demonstrate that the proposed framework effectively safeguards datasets with minimal impact on original task performance. We also show that adding just 1% of watermarking samples can inject a traceable watermarking function and that our watermarking samples are stealthy and look benign upon visual inspection.",

        "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) and human-machine interaction (HMI) are two keywords that usually do not fit embedded applications. Within the steps needed before applying AI to solve a specific task, HMI is usually missing during the AI architecture design and the training of an AI model. The human-in-the-loop concept is prevalent in all other steps of developing AI, from data analysis via data selection and cleaning to performance evaluation. During AI architecture design, HMI can immediately highlight unproductive layers of the architecture so that lightweight network architecture for embedded applications can be created easily. We show that by using this HMI, users can instantly distinguish which AI architecture should be trained and evaluated first since a high accuracy on the task could be expected. This approach reduces the resources needed for AI development by avoiding training and evaluating AI architectures with unproductive layers and leads to lightweight AI architectures. These resulting lightweight AI architectures will enable HMI while running the AI on an edge device. By enabling HMI during an AI uses inference, we will introduce the AI-in-the-loop concept that combines AI's and humans' strengths. In our AI-in-the-loop approach, the AI remains the working horse and primarily solves the task. If the AI is unsure whether its inference solves the task correctly, it asks the user to use an appropriate HMI. Consequently, AI will become available in many applications soon since HMI will make AI more reliable and explainable.",

These data include hospital architectural drawings, logs of interactions between patients and healthcare professionals, prescription data, procedures data, and data on patient admission, discharge, and transfers. This has opened up many fascinating avenues for healthcare-related prediction tasks for improving patient care. However, in order to leverage off-the-shelf machine learning software for these tasks, one needs to learn structured representations of entities involved from heterogeneous, dynamic data streams. Here, we propose DECENT, an auto-encoding heterogeneous co-evolving dynamic neural network, for learning heterogeneous dynamic embeddings of patients, doctors, rooms, and medications from diverse data streams. These embeddings capture similarities among doctors, rooms, patients, and medications based on static attributes and dynamic interactions. DECENT enables several applications in healthcare prediction, such as predicting mortality risk and case severity of patients, adverse events (e.g., transfer back into an intensive care unit), and future healthcare-associated infections. The results of using the learned patient embeddings in predictive modeling show that DECENT has a gain of up to 48.1% on the mortality risk prediction task, 12.6% on the case severity prediction task, 6.4% on the medical intensive care unit transfer task, and 3.8% on the Clostridioides difficile (C.diff) Infection (CDI) prediction task over the state-of-the-art baselines.

We argue that, one method to address this difficulty is now to present a standard assessment criteria and dataset, better a large-scale dataset covered multiple aspects of ToM.",

        "abstract": "Prevalent predictive coding-based video compression methods rely on a heavy encoder to reduce the temporal redundancy, which makes it challenging to deploy them on resource-constrained devices. Meanwhile, as early as the 1970s, distributed source coding theory has indicated that independent encoding and joint decoding with side information (SI) can achieve high-efficient compression of correlated sources. This has inspired a distributed coding architecture aiming at reducing the encoding complexity. However, traditional distributed coding methods suffer from a substantial performance gap to predictive coding ones. Inspired by the great success of learning-based compression, we propose the first end-to-end distributed deep video compression framework to improve the rate-distortion performance. A key ingredient is an effective SI generation module at the decoder, which helps to effectively exploit inter-frame correlations without computation-intensive encoder-side motion estimation and compensation. Experiments show that our method significantly outperforms conventional distributed video coding and H.264. Meanwhile, it enjoys 6-7x encoding speedup against DVC [1] with comparable compression performance. Code is released at https://github.com/Xinjie-Q/Distributed-DVC.",

        "abstract": "With the development of deep learning, advanced dialogue generation methods usually require a greater amount of computational resources. One promising approach to obtaining a high-performance and lightweight model is knowledge distillation, which relies heavily on the pre-trained powerful teacher. Collaborative learning, also known as online knowledge distillation, is an effective way to conduct one-stage group distillation in the absence of a well-trained large teacher model. However, previous work has a severe branch homogeneity problem due to the same training objective and the independent identical training sets. To alleviate this problem, we consider the dialogue attributes in the training of network branches. Each branch learns the attribute-related features based on the selected subset. Furthermore, we propose a dual group-based knowledge distillation method, consisting of positive distillation and negative distillation, to further diversify the features of different branches in a steadily and interpretable way. The proposed approach significantly improves branch heterogeneity and outperforms state-of-the-art collaborative learning methods on two widely used open-domain dialogue datasets.",

        "abstract": "This paper proposes an assessor-guided learning strategy for continual learning where an assessor guides the learning process of a base learner by controlling the direction and pace of the learning process thus allowing an efficient learning of new environments while protecting against the catastrophic interference problem. The assessor is trained in a meta-learning manner with a meta-objective to boost the learning process of the base learner. It performs a soft-weighting mechanism of every sample accepting positive samples while rejecting negative samples. The training objective of a base learner is to minimize a meta-weighted combination of the cross entropy loss function, the dark experience replay (DER) loss function and the knowledge distillation loss function whose interactions are controlled in such a way to attain an improved performance. A compensated over-sampling (COS) strategy is developed to overcome the class imbalanced problem of the episodic memory due to limited memory budgets. Our approach, Assessor-Guided Learning Approach (AGLA), has been evaluated in the class-incremental and task-incremental learning problems. AGLA achieves improved performances compared to its competitors while the theoretical analysis of the COS strategy is offered.

Our method consists of two loss functions: (1) a point-based unary loss that constrains the bounding box of predicted polygons to achieve coarse-grained segmentation; and (2) a distance-aware pairwise loss that encourages the predicted polygons to fit the object boundaries. Compared with the mask-based weakly-supervised methods, BoxSnake further reduces the performance gap between the predicted segmentation and the bounding box, and shows significant superiority on the Cityscapes dataset.",

We demonstrate attacks in which an adversary can manipulate the upstream model to conduct highly effective and specific property inference attacks (AUC score $&gt; 0.9$), without incurring significant performance loss on the main task. The main idea of the manipulation is to make the upstream model generate activations (intermediate features) with different distributions for samples with and without a target property, thus enabling the adversary to distinguish easily between downstream models trained with and without training examples that have the target property.

However, it has been found that models trained with federated learning usually have worse performance than their counterparts trained in the standard centralized learning mode, especially when the training data is imbalanced. In the context of federated learning, data imbalance may occur either locally one one client device, or globally across many devices. The complexity of different types of data imbalance has posed challenges to the development of federated learning technique, especially considering the need of relieving data imbalance issue and preserving data privacy at the same time. Therefore, in the literature, many attempts have been made to handle class imbalance in federated learning. In this paper, we present a detailed review of recent advancements along this line. We first introduce various types of class imbalance in federated learning, after which we review existing methods for estimating the extent of class imbalance without the need of knowing the actual data to preserve data privacy. After that, we discuss existing methods for handling class imbalance in FL, where the advantages and disadvantages of the these approaches are discussed.

To demonstrate the connection between SSL and OSR, we theoretically and experimentally compare state-of-the-art SSL-GAN methods with state-of-the-art OSR-GAN methods. Our results indicate that the SSL optimised margin-GANs, which have a stronger foundation in literature, set the new standard for the combined SSL-OSR task and achieves new state-of-other art results in certain general OSR experiments.

An explanation here is a sequence of simple inference steps where simplicity is quantified using a cost function. The algorithms for explanation generation rely on extracting Minimal Unsatisfiable Subsets (MUS) of a derived unsatisfiable formula, exploiting a one-to-one correspondence between so-called non-redundant explanations and MUSs. However, MUS extraction algorithms do not provide any guarantee of subset minimality or optimality with respect to a given cost function. Therefore, we build on these formal foundations and tackle the main points of improvement, namely how to generate explanations efficiently that are provably optimal (with respect to the given cost metric). For that, we developed (1) a hitting set-based algorithm for finding the optimal constrained unsatisfiable subsets; (2) a method for re-using relevant information over multiple algorithm calls; and (3) methods exploiting domain-specific information to speed up the explanation sequence generation. We experimentally validated our algorithms on a large number of CSP problems. We found that our algorithms outperform the MUS approach in terms of explanation quality and computational time (on average up to 56 % faster than a standard MUS approach).",

For example, volatility modeling in finance relies on a set of risk factors, and climate change studies in climatology rely on a set of causal factors. The ideal low-dimensional style factors should balance significance (with high explanatory power) and stability (consistent, no significant fluctuations). However, previous supervised and unsupervised feature extraction methods can hardly address the tradeoff. In this paper, we propose Style Miner, a reinforcement learning method to generate style factors. We first formulate the problem as a Constrained Markov Decision Process with explanatory power as the return and stability as the constraint. Then, we design fine-grained immediate rewards and costs and use a Lagrangian heuristic to balance them adaptively. Experiments on real-world financial data sets show that Style Miner outperforms existing learning-based methods by a large margin and achieves a relatively 10% gain in R-squared explanatory power compared to the industry-renowned factors proposed by human experts.",

        "abstract": "As ChatGPT goes viral, generative AI (AIGC, a.k.a AI-generated content) has made headlines everywhere because of its ability to analyze and create text, images, and beyond. With such overwhelming media coverage, it is almost impossible for us to miss the opportunity to glimpse AIGC from a certain angle. In the era of AI transitioning from pure analysis to creation, it is worth noting that ChatGPT, with its most recent language model GPT-4, is just a tool out of numerous AIGC tasks. Impressed by the capability of the ChatGPT, many people are wondering about its limits: can GPT-5 (or other future GPT variants) help ChatGPT unify all AIGC tasks for diversified content creation? Toward answering this question, a comprehensive review of existing AIGC tasks is needed. As such, our work comes to fill this gap promptly by offering a first look at AIGC, ranging from its techniques to applications. Modern generative AI relies on various technical foundations, ranging from model architecture and self-supervised pretraining to generative modeling methods (like GAN and diffusion models). After introducing the fundamental techniques, this work focuses on the technological development of various AIGC tasks based on their output type, including text, images, videos, 3D content, etc., which depicts the full potential of ChatGPT's future. Moreover, we summarize their significant applications in some mainstream industries, such as education and creativity content.

In addition, a self-supervised structure constraint is proposed to further learn the intrinsic information about the structures. With only light training data, the pretrained structure model can obtain better generalization ability. To quantitatively evaluate the proposed structure models, we design a series of rational evaluation methods, including internal tasks (e.g., contact map prediction, distribution alignment quality) and external/downstream tasks (e.g., protein design).

However, during the federal training process, some of the devices fail to collect enough data for local training, while new devices will be included to the group training. This leads to an unbalanced global data distribution and thus affect the performance of the global model training.

KGs exhibit relational patterns such as symmetry and composition and modeling the patterns can further enhance the performance of query embedding models. However, the role of such patterns in answering FOL queries by query embedding models has not been yet studied in the literature. In this paper, we fill in this research gap and empower FOL queries reasoning with pattern inference by introducing an inductive bias that allows for learning relation patterns. To this end, we develop a novel query embedding method, RoConE, that defines query regions as geometric cones and algebraic query operators by rotations in complex space. RoConE combines the advantages of Cone as a well-specified geometric representation for query embedding, and also the rotation operator as a powerful algebraic operation for pattern inference.

However, the self-attention mechanism often used in Transformers requires large time windows for each computation step and thus makes them less suitable for online signal processing compared to Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). In this paper, instead of the self-attention mechanism, we use a sliding window attention mechanism. We show that this mechanism is more efficient for continuous signals with finite-range dependencies between input and target, and that we can use it to process sequences element-by-element, this making it compatible with online processing. We test our model on a finger position regression dataset (NinaproDB8) with Surface Electromyographic (sEMG) signals measured on the forearm skin to estimate muscle activities. Our approach sets the new state-of-the-art in terms of accuracy on this dataset while requiring only very short time windows of 3.5 ms at each inference step. Moreover, we increase the sparsity of the network using Leaky-Integrate and Fire (LIF) units, a bio-inspired neuron model that activates sparsely in time solely when crossing a threshold. We thus reduce the number of synaptic operations up to a factor of $\\times5.3$ without loss of accuracy.

However, they have overlooked the impact of the knowledge transfer when the dataset in a certain task is biased - namely, when some unintended spurious correlations of the tasks are learned from the biased dataset. In that case, how would they affect learning future tasks or the knowledge already learned from the past tasks? In this work, we carefully design systematic experiments using one synthetic and two real-world datasets to answer the question from our empirical findings. Specifically, we first show through two-task CL experiments that standard CL methods, which are unaware of dataset bias, can transfer biases from one task to another, both forward and backward, and this transfer is exacerbated depending on whether the CL methods focus on the stability or the plasticity. We then present that the bias transfer also exists and even accumulate in longer sequences of tasks. Finally, we propose a simple, yet strong plug-in method for debiasing-aware continual learning, dubbed as Group-class Balanced Greedy Sampling (BGS). As a result, we show that our BGS can always reduce the bias of a CL model, with a slight loss of CL performance at most.",

        "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11884",
        "abstract": "Deep neural networks are very successful on many vision tasks, but hard to interpret due to their black box nature. To overcome this, various post-hoc attribution methods have been proposed to identify image regions most influential to the models' decisions. Evaluating such methods is challenging since no ground truth attributions exist. We thus propose three novel evaluation schemes to more reliably measure the faithfulness of those methods, to make comparisons between them more fair, and to make visual inspection more systematic. To address faithfulness, we propose a novel evaluation setting (DiFull) in which we carefully control which parts of the input can influence the output in order to distinguish possible from impossible attributions. To address fairness, we note that different methods are applied at different layers, which skews any comparison, and so evaluate all methods on the same layers (ML-Att) and discuss how this impacts their performance on quantitative metrics. For more systematic visualizations, we propose a scheme (AggAtt) to qualitatively evaluate the methods on complete datasets. We use these evaluation schemes to study strengths and shortcomings of some widely used attribution methods over a wide range of models. Finally, we propose a post-processing smoothing step that significantly improves the performance of some attribution methods, and discuss its applicability.",

Sensors are critical to autonomous driving's security and feasibility to perceive the surrounding environment. Multi-Sensor fusion has become a current research hot spot because of its potential for multidimensional perception and integration ability. In this paper, we propose a novel feature-level multi-sensor fusion technology for end-to-end autonomous driving navigation with imitation learning. Our paper mainly focuses on fusion technologies for Lidar and RGB information. We also provide a brand-new penalty-based imitation learning method to reinforce the model's compliance with traffic rules and unify the objective of imitation learning and the metric of autonomous driving.",

        "abstract": "Adaptive traffic signal control with Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning(MARL) is a very popular topic nowadays. In most existing novel methods, one agent controls single intersections and these methods focus on the cooperation between intersections. However, the non-stationary property of MARL still limits the performance of the above methods as the size of traffic networks grows. One compromised strategy is to assign one agent with a region of intersections to reduce the number of agents. There are two challenges in this strategy, one is how to partition a traffic network into small regions and the other is how to search for the optimal joint actions for a region of intersections. In this paper, we propose a novel training framework RegionLight where our region partition rule is based on the adjacency between the intersection and extended Branching Dueling Q-Network(BDQ) to Dynamic Branching Dueling Q-Network(DBDQ) to bound the growth of the size of joint action space and alleviate the bias introduced by imaginary intersections outside of the boundary of the traffic network. Our experiments on both real datasets and synthetic datasets demonstrate that our framework performs best among other novel frameworks and that our region partition rule is robust.",

Deephys provides seamless analyses of individual neurons, individual images, and a set of set of images from a category, and it is capable of revealing failures due to the presence of spurious features and novel features.

The level of coarseness increases from the trivial set, which only comprises singletons, to the set, which only contains the grand coalition. In addition, it is possible to establish meronomies, i.e., part-whole relationships, via a domain expert that can be utilised to generate explanations at an abstract level. We illustrate the usability of this approach in a real-world car model example and the Titanic dataset, where intermediate concepts aid in explainability at different levels of abstraction.",

To mitigate this issue, the usage of 'model guidance' has gained popularity recently: for this, models are guided to be \"right for the right reasons\" by regularizing the models' explanations to highlight the right features. Experimental validation of these approaches has thus far however been limited to relatively simple and / or synthetic datasets. To gain a better understanding of which model-guiding approaches actually transfer to more challenging real-world datasets, in this work we conduct an in-depth evaluation across various loss functions, attribution methods, models, and 'guidance depths' on the PASCAL VOC 2007 and MS COCO 2014 datasets, and show that model guidance can sometimes even improve model performance. In this context, we further propose a novel energy loss, show its effectiveness in directing the model to focus on object features. We also show that these gains can be achieved even with a small fraction (e.g. 1%) of bounding box annotations, highlighting the cost effectiveness of this approach. Lastly, we show that this approach can also improve generalization under distribution shifts. Code will be made available.",

In this work, we propose an end-to-end instance-wise and prototype-wise contrastive learning model with a cross-attention mechanism for cross-domain rumor detection. The model not only performs cross-domain feature alignment but also enforces target samples to align with the corresponding prototypes of a given source domain. Since target labels in a target domain are unavailable, we use a clustering-based approach with carefully initialized centers by a batch of source domain samples to produce pseudo labels. Moreover, we use a cross-attention mechanism on a pair of source data and target data with the same labels to learn domain-invariant representations. Because the samples in a domain pair tend to express similar semantic patterns, especially on the people's attitudes (e.g., supporting or denying) towards the same category of rumors, the discrepancy between a pair of the source domain and target domain will be decreased. We conduct experiments on four groups of cross-domain datasets and show that our proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance.",

        "abstract": "Bike sharing is emerging globally as an active, convenient, and sustainable mode of transportation. To plan successful bike-sharing systems (BSSs), many cities start from a small-scale pilot and gradually expand the system to cover more areas. For station-based BSSs, this means planning new stations based on existing ones over time, which requires prediction of the number of trips generated by these new stations across the whole system. Previous studies typically rely on relatively simple regression or machine learning models, which are limited in capturing complex spatial relationships. Despite the growing literature in deep learning methods for travel demand prediction, they are mostly developed for short-term prediction based on time series data, assuming no structural changes to the system. In this study, we focus on the trip generation problem for BSS expansion, and propose a graph neural network (GNN) approach to predicting the station-level demand based on multi-source urban built environment data. Specifically, it constructs multiple localized graphs centered on each target station and uses attention mechanisms to learn the correlation weights between stations. We further illustrate that the proposed approach can be regarded as a generalized spatial regression model, indicating the commonalities between spatial regression and GNNs. The model is evaluated based on realistic experiments using multi-year BSS data from New York City, and the results validate the superior performance of our approach compared to existing methods. We also demonstrate the interpretability of the model for uncovering the effects of built environment features and spatial interactions between stations, which can provide strategic guidance for BSS station location selection and capacity planning.",

In this work, we present T-Dex, a new approach for tactile-based dexterity, that operates in two phases. In the first phase, we collect 2.5 hours of play data, which is used to train self-supervised tactile encoders. This is necessary to bring high-dimensional tactile readings to a lower-dimensional embedding. In the second phase, given a handful of demonstrations for a dexterous task, we learn non-parametric policies that combine the tactile observations with visual ones. Across five challenging dexterous tasks, we show that our tactile-based dexterity models outperform purely vision and torque-based models by an average of 1.7X.

        "abstract": "Estimation-of-distribution algorithms (EDAs) are optimization algorithms that learn a distribution on the search space from which good solutions can be sampled easily. A key parameter of most EDAs is the sample size (population size). If the population size is too small, the update of the probabilistic model builds on few samples, leading to the undesired effect of genetic drift. Too large population sizes avoid genetic drift, but slow down the process.  Building on a recent quantitative analysis of how the population size leads to genetic drift, we design a smart-restart mechanism for EDAs. By stopping runs when the risk for genetic drift is high, it automatically runs the EDA in good parameter regimes.  Via a mathematical runtime analysis, we prove a general performance guarantee for this smart-restart scheme. This in particular shows that in many situations where the optimal (problem-specific) parameter values are known, the restart scheme automatically finds these, leading to the asymptotically optimal performance.  We also conduct an extensive experimental analysis. On four classic benchmark problems, we clearly observe the critical influence of the population size on the performance, and we find that the smart-restart scheme leads to a performance close to the one obtainable with optimal parameter values. Our results also show that previous theory-based suggestions for the optimal population size can be far from the optimal ones, leading to a performance clearly inferior to the one obtained via the smart-restart scheme. We also conduct experiments with PBIL (cross-entropy algorithm) on two combinatorial optimization problems from the literature, the max-cut problem and the bipartition problem. Again, we observe that the smart-restart mechanism finds much better values for the population size than those suggested in the literature, leading to a much better performance.",

In this paper, we introduce a novel initiative advisor-in-the-loop actor-critic framework, termed as Ask-AC, that replaces the unilateral advisor-guidance mechanism with a bidirectional learner-initiative one, and thereby enables a customized and efficacious message exchange between learner and advisor. At the heart of Ask-AC are two complementary components, namely action requester and adaptive state selector, that can be readily incorporated into various discrete actor-critic architectures. The former component allows the agent to initiatively seek advisor intervention in the presence of uncertain states, while the latter identifies the unstable states potentially missed by the former especially when environment changes, and then learns to promote the ask action on such states. Experimental results on both stationary and non-stationary environments and across different actor-critic backbones demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly improves the learning efficiency of the agent, and achieves the performances on par with those obtained by continuous advisor monitoring.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we analyze batch normalization from the perspective of discriminability and find the disadvantages ignored by previous studies: the difference in $l_2$ norms of sample features can hinder batch normalization from obtaining more distinguished inter-class features and more compact intra-class features. To address this issue, we propose a simple yet effective method to equalize the $l_2$ norms of sample features. Concretely, we $l_2$-normalize each sample feature before feeding them into batch normalization, and therefore the features are of the same magnitude. Since the proposed method combines the $l_2$ normalization and batch normalization, we name our method $L_2$BN. The $L_2$BN can strengthen the compactness of intra-class features and enlarge the discrepancy of inter-class features. The $L_2$BN is easy to implement and can exert its effect without any additional parameters or hyper-parameters. We evaluate the effectiveness of $L_2$BN through extensive experiments with various models on image classification and acoustic scene classification tasks. The results demonstrate that the $L_2$BN can boost the generalization ability of various neural network models and achieve considerable performance improvements.",

        "abstract": "Recent advances in self-supervised learning have integrated Masked Image Modeling (MIM) and Siamese Networks into a unified framework that leverages the benefits of both techniques. However, several issues remain unaddressed when applying conventional erase-based masking with Siamese ConvNets. These include (I) the inability to drop uninformative masked regions in ConvNets as they process data continuously, resulting in low training efficiency compared to ViT models; and (II) the mismatch between erase-based masking and the contrastive-based objective in Siamese ConvNets, which differs from the MIM approach. In this paper, we propose a filling-based masking strategy called MixMask to prevent information incompleteness caused by the randomly erased regions in an image in the vanilla masking method. Furthermore, we introduce a flexible loss function design that considers the semantic distance change between two different mixed views to adapt the integrated architecture and prevent mismatches between the transformed input and objective in Masked Siamese ConvNets (MSCN). We conducted extensive experiments on various datasets, including CIFAR-100, Tiny-ImageNet, and ImageNet-1K. The results demonstrate that our proposed framework achieves superior accuracy on linear probing, semi-supervised, and supervised finetuning, outperforming the state-of-the-art MSCN by a significant margin.

        "abstract": "Objective: A major challenge in designing closed-loop brain-computer interfaces is finding optimal stimulation patterns as a function of ongoing neural activity for different subjects and objectives. Approach: To achieve goal-directed closed-loop neurostimulation, we propose \"neural co-processors\" which use artificial neural networks and deep learning to learn optimal closed-loop stimulation policies, shaping neural activity and bridging injured neural circuits for targeted repair and rehabilitation. The co-processor adapts the stimulation policy as the biological circuit itself adapts to the stimulation, achieving a form of brain-device co-adaptation. Here we use simulations to lay the groundwork for future in vivo tests of neural co-processors. We leverage a cortical model of grasping, to which we applied various forms of simulated lesions, allowing us to develop the critical learning algorithms and study adaptations to non-stationarity. Main results: Our simulations show the ability of a neural co-processor to learn a stimulation policy using a supervised learning approach, and to adapt that policy as the underlying brain and sensors change. Our co-processor successfully co-adapted with the simulated brain to accomplish the reach-and-grasp task after a variety of lesions were applied, achieving recovery towards healthy function. Significance: Our results provide the first proof-of-concept demonstration of a co-processor for adaptive activity-dependent closed-loop neurostimulation, optimizing for a rehabilitation goal. While a gap remains between simulations and applications, our results provide insights on how co-processors may be developed for learning complex adaptive stimulation policies for a variety of neural rehabilitation and neuroprosthetic applications.",

To mitigate such degradation, existing methods typically add perturbations to the DNN weights during training to simulate inference on noisy hardware. However, this often requires knowledge about the target hardware and leads to a trade-off between DNN performance and robustness, decreasing the former to increase the latter. In this work, we show that applying sharpness-aware training, by optimizing for both the loss value and loss sharpness, significantly improves robustness to noisy hardware at inference time without relying on any assumptions about the target hardware. In particular, we propose a new adaptive sharpness-aware method that conditions the worst-case perturbation of a given weight not only on its magnitude but also on the range of the weight distribution. This is achieved by performing sharpness-aware minimization scaled by outlier minimization (SAMSON). Our approach outperforms existing sharpness-aware training methods both in terms of model generalization performance in noiseless regimes and robustness in noisy settings, as measured on several architectures and datasets.",

        "abstract": "We derive a learning framework to generate routing/pickup policies for a fleet of autonomous vehicles tasked with servicing stochastically appearing requests on a city map. We focus on policies that 1) give rise to coordination amongst the vehicles, thereby reducing wait times for servicing requests, 2) are non-myopic, and consider a-priori potential future requests, 3) can adapt to changes in the underlying demand distribution. Specifically, we are interested in policies that are adaptive to fluctuations of actual demand conditions in urban environments, such as on-peak vs. off-peak hours. We achieve this through a combination of (i) an online play algorithm that improves the performance of an offline-trained policy, and (ii) an offline approximation scheme that allows for adapting to changes in the underlying demand model. In particular, we achieve adaptivity of our learned policy to different demand distributions by quantifying a region of validity using the q-valid radius of a Wasserstein Ambiguity Set. We propose a mechanism for switching the originally trained offline approximation when the current demand is outside the original validity region. In this case, we propose to use an offline architecture, trained on a historical demand model that is closer to the current demand in terms of Wasserstein distance. We learn routing and pickup policies over real taxicab requests in San Francisco with high variability between on-peak and off-peak hours, demonstrating the ability of our method to adapt to real fluctuation in demand distributions. Our numerical results demonstrate that our method outperforms alternative rollout-based reinforcement learning schemes, as well as other classical methods from operations research.",

        "abstract": "The discovery of drug-target interactions (DTIs) is a pivotal process in pharmaceutical development. Computational approaches are a promising and efficient alternative to tedious and costly wet-lab experiments for predicting novel DTIs from numerous candidates. Recently, with the availability of abundant heterogeneous biological information from diverse data sources, computational methods have been able to leverage multiple drug and target similarities to boost the performance of DTI prediction. Similarity integration is an effective and flexible strategy to extract crucial information across complementary similarity views, providing a compressed input for any similarity-based DTI prediction model. However, existing similarity integration methods filter and fuse similarities from a global perspective, neglecting the utility of similarity views for each drug and target. In this study, we propose a Fine-Grained Selective similarity integration approach, called FGS, which employs a local interaction consistency-based weight matrix to capture and exploit the importance of similarities at a finer granularity in both similarity selection and combination steps. We evaluate FGS on five DTI prediction datasets under various prediction settings. Experimental results show that our method not only outperforms similarity integration competitors with comparable computational costs, but also achieves better prediction performance than state-of-the-art DTI prediction approaches by collaborating with conventional base models. Furthermore, case studies on the analysis of similarity weights and on the verification of novel predictions confirm the practical ability of FGS.",

By using the pre-trained models to encode the scene and instructions as inputs for decision making, the instruction-conditioned policy can generalize across different objects and tasks. While this is encouraging, the policy still fails in most cases given an unseen task or environment. In this work, we propose Policy Adaptation from Foundation model Feedback (PAFF). When deploying the trained policy to a new task or a new environment, we first let the policy play with randomly generated instructions to record the demonstrations. While the execution could be wrong, we can use the pre-trained foundation models to provide feedback to relabel the demonstrations. This automatically provides new pairs of demonstration-instruction data for policy fine-tuning. We evaluate our method on a broad range of experiments with the focus on generalization on unseen objects, unseen tasks, unseen environments, and sim-to-real transfer.

        "abstract": "Hierarchical learning algorithms that gradually approximate a solution to a data-driven optimization problem are essential to decision-making systems, especially under limitations on time and computational resources. In this study, we introduce a general-purpose hierarchical learning architecture that is based on the progressive partitioning of a possibly multi-resolution data space. The optimal partition is gradually approximated by solving a sequence of optimization sub-problems that yield a sequence of partitions with increasing number of subsets. We show that the solution of each optimization problem can be estimated online using gradient-free stochastic approximation updates. As a consequence, a function approximation problem can be defined within each subset of the partition and solved using the theory of two-timescale stochastic approximation algorithms. This simulates an annealing process and defines a robust and interpretable heuristic method to gradually increase the complexity of the learning architecture in a task-agnostic manner, giving emphasis to regions of the data space that are considered more important according to a predefined criterion. Finally, by imposing a tree structure in the progression of the partitions, we provide a means to incorporate potential multi-resolution structure of the data space into this approach, significantly reducing its complexity, while introducing hierarchical variable-rate feature extraction properties similar to certain classes of deep learning architectures. Asymptotic convergence analysis and experimental results are provided for supervised and unsupervised learning problems.",

However, the performance of frequency identification methods heavily hinges on the amount of user calibration data and data length, which hinders the deployment in real-world applications. Recently, generative adversarial networks (GANs)-based data generation methods have been widely adopted to create synthetic electroencephalography (EEG) data, holds promise to address these issues. In this paper, we proposed a GAN-based end-to-end signal transformation network for data length extension, termed as TEGAN. TEGAN transforms short-length SSVEP signals into long-length artificial SSVEP signals. By incorporating a novel U-Net generator architecture and an auxiliary classifier into the network architecture, the TEGAN could produce conditioned features in the synthetic data. Additionally, we introduced a two-stage training strategy and the LeCam-divergence regularization term to regularize the training process of GAN during the network implementation. The proposed TEGAN was evaluated on two public SSVEP datasets (a 4-class dataset and a 12-class dataset). With the assistance of TEGAN, the performance of traditional frequency recognition methods and deep learning-based methods have been significantly improved under limited calibration data. And the classification performance gap of various frequency recognition methods has been narrowed. This study substantiates the feasibility of the proposed method to extend the data length for short-time SSVEP signals for developing a high-performance BCI system.

In this paper, we aim to introduce diversity in the Unsupervised Environment Design (UED) framework. Specifically, we propose a task-agnostic method to identify observed/hidden states that are representative of a given level. The outcome of this method is then utilized to characterize the diversity between two levels, which as we show can be crucial to effective performance.

Given these two base-level triplets, we see that $T_1$ is a prerequisite for $T_2$. In this paper, we define a higher-level triplet to represent a relationship between triplets, e.g., $\\langle T_1$, PrerequisiteFor, $T_2\\rangle$ where PrerequisiteFor is a higher-level relation. We define a bi-level knowledge graph that consists of the base-level and the higher-level triplets. We also propose a data augmentation strategy based on the random walks on the bi-level knowledge graph to augment plausible triplets. Our model called BiVE learns embeddings by taking into account the structures of the base-level and the higher-level triplets, with additional consideration of the augmented triplets. We propose two new tasks: triplet prediction and conditional link prediction. Given a triplet $T_1$ and a higher-level relation, the triplet prediction predicts a triplet that is likely to be connected to $T_1$ by the higher-level relation, e.g., $\\langle T_1$, PrerequisiteFor, ?$\\rangle$. The conditional link prediction predicts a missing entity in a triplet conditioned on another triplet, e.g., $\\langle T_1$, PrerequisiteFor, (Avatar, Wins, ?)$\\rangle$.

Despite their decent performance, we argue one potential limitation of these methods -- the embedding magnitude has not been explicitly modulated, which may aggravate popularity bias and training instability, hindering the model from making a good recommendation. It motivates us to leverage the embedding normalization in recommendation. By normalizing user/item embeddings to a specific value, we empirically observe impressive performance gains (9\\% on average) on four real-world datasets. Although encouraging, we also reveal a serious limitation when applying normalization in recommendation -- the performance is highly sensitive to the choice of the temperature $\\tau$ which controls the scale of the normalized embeddings.  To fully foster the merits of the normalization while circumvent its limitation, this work studied on how to adaptively set the proper $\\tau$. Towards this end, we first make a comprehensive analyses of $\\tau$ to fully understand its role on recommendation.

Enormous efforts have been made by exploring the seed's structure. However, existing approaches are deficient in their mining of structural information in two ways: poor modeling of the hierarchical semantics and failure to capture directionality of is-a relation. This paper seeks to address these issues by explicitly denoting each node as the combination of inherited feature (i.e., structural part) and incremental feature (i.e., supplementary part). Specifically, the inherited feature originates from \"parent\" nodes and is weighted by an inheritance factor. With this node representation, the hierarchy of semantics in taxonomies (i.e., the inheritance and accumulation of features from \"parent\" to \"child\") could be embodied. Additionally, based on this representation, the directionality of is-a relation could be easily translated into the irreversible inheritance of features. Inspired by the Darmois-Skitovich Theorem, we implement this irreversibility by a non-Gaussian constraint on the supplementary feature. A log-likelihood learning objective is further utilized to optimize the proposed model (dubbed DNG), whereby the required non-Gaussianity is also theoretically ensured. Extensive experimental results on two real-world datasets verify the superiority of DNG relative to several strong baselines.",

The Vid2Seq architecture augments a language model with special time tokens, allowing it to seamlessly predict event boundaries and textual descriptions in the same output sequence. Such a unified model requires large-scale training data, which is not available in current annotated datasets. We show that it is possible to leverage unlabeled narrated videos for dense video captioning, by reformulating sentence boundaries of transcribed speech as pseudo event boundaries, and using the transcribed speech sentences as pseudo event captions. The resulting Vid2Seq model pretrained on the YT-Temporal-1B dataset improves the state of the art on a variety of dense video captioning benchmarks including YouCook2, ViTT and ActivityNet Captions. Vid2Seq also generalizes well to the tasks of video paragraph captioning and video clip captioning, and to few-shot settings.

        "abstract": "Explicit exploration in the action space was assumed to be indispensable for online policy gradient methods to avoid a drastic degradation in sample complexity, for solving general reinforcement learning problems over finite state and action spaces. In this paper, we establish for the first time an $\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(1/\\epsilon^2)$ sample complexity for online policy gradient methods without incorporating any exploration strategies. The essential development consists of two new on-policy evaluation operators and a novel analysis of the stochastic policy mirror descent method (SPMD). SPMD with the first evaluation operator, called value-based estimation, tailors to the Kullback-Leibler divergence. Provided the Markov chains on the state space of generated policies are uniformly mixing with non-diminishing minimal visitation measure, an $\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(1/\\epsilon^2)$ sample complexity is obtained with a linear dependence on the size of the action space. SPMD with the second evaluation operator, namely truncated on-policy Monte Carlo (TOMC), attains an $\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(\\mathcal{H}_{\\mathcal{D}}/\\epsilon^2)$ sample complexity, where $\\mathcal{H}_{\\mathcal{D}}$ mildly depends on the effective horizon and the size of the action space with properly chosen Bregman divergence (e.g., Tsallis divergence). SPMD with TOMC also exhibits stronger convergence properties in that it controls the optimality gap with high probability rather than in expectation. In contrast to explicit exploration, these new policy gradient methods can prevent repeatedly committing to potentially high-risk actions when searching for optimal policies.",

        "abstract": "Sign language recognition (SLR) is a weakly supervised task that annotates sign videos as textual glosses. Recent studies show that insufficient training caused by the lack of large-scale available sign language datasets becomes the main bottleneck for SLR. The majority of SLR works thereby adopt pretrained visual modules and develop two mainstream solutions. The multi-stream architectures extend multi-cue visual features, yielding the current SOTA performances but requiring complex designs and might introduce potential noise. Alternatively, the advanced single-cue SLR frameworks using explicit cross-modal alignment between visual and textual modalities are simple and effective, potentially competitive with the multi-cue framework. In this work, we propose a novel contrastive visual-textual transformation for SLR, CVT-SLR, to fully explore the pretrained knowledge of both the visual and language modalities. Based on the single-cue cross-modal alignment framework, we propose a variational autoencoder (VAE) for pretrained contextual knowledge while introducing the complete pretrained language module. The VAE implicitly aligns visual and textual modalities while benefiting from pretrained contextual knowledge as the traditional contextual module. Meanwhile, a contrastive cross-modal alignment algorithm is proposed to further enhance the explicit consistency constraints. Extensive experiments conducted on the two most popular public datasets, PHOENIX-2014 and PHOENIX-2014T, demonstrate that our proposed SLR framework not only consistently outperforms existing single-cue methods but even outperforms SOTA multi-cue methods.",

The purpose of this work is to provide a policy that approximately maximizes exploration efficiency (i.e., how well the graph is recovered for a given exploration budget). In the unaliased case, we show improved performance w.r.t. state-of-the-art reinforcement learning baselines. For the aliased case we are not aware of suitable baselines and instead show faster recovery w.r.t. a random policy for a wide variety of topologies, and exponentially faster recovery than a random policy for challenging topologies.

This challenge underscores the importance of detecting out-of-distribution (OOD) samples in the open world. In this work, we propose a novel feature-space OOD detection score that jointly reasons with both class-specific and class-agnostic information. Specifically, our approach utilizes Whitened Linear Discriminative Analysis to project features into two subspaces - the discriminative and residual subspaces - in which the ID classes are maximally separated and closely clustered, respectively. The OOD score is then determined by combining the deviation from the input data to the ID distribution in both subspaces. The efficacy of our method, named WDiscOOD, is verified on the large-scale ImageNet-1k benchmark, with six OOD datasets that covers a variety of distribution shifts. WDiscOOD demonstrates superior performance on deep classifiers with diverse backbone architectures, including CNN and vision transformer. Furthermore, we also show that our method can more effectively detect novel concepts in representation space trained with contrastive objectives, including supervised contrastive loss and multi-modality contrastive loss.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we consider fine-grained image object detection in resource-constrained cases such as edge computing. Deep learning (DL), namely learning with deep neural networks (DNNs), has become the dominating approach to object detection. To achieve accurate fine-grained detection, one needs to employ a large enough DNN model and a vast amount of data annotations, which brings a challenge for using modern DL object detectors in resource-constrained cases. To this end, we propose an approach, which leverages commonsense knowledge to assist a coarse-grained object detector to get accurate fine-grained detection results. Specifically, we introduce a commonsense knowledge inference module (CKIM) to translate coarse-grained labels given by a backbone lightweight coarse-grained DL detector to fine-grained labels. We consider both crisp-rule and fuzzy-rule based inference in our CKIM; the latter is used to handle ambiguity in the target semantic labels. We implement our method based on several modern DL detectors, namely YOLOv4, Mobilenetv3-SSD and YOLOv7-tiny. Experiment results show that our approach outperforms benchmark detectors remarkably in terms of accuracy, model size and processing latency.",

The t-SPN is constructed such that the unnormalized probability is represented as conditional probabilities of a subset of most similar cell classes. The constructed t-SPN architecture is learned by maximizing the margin, which is the difference in the conditional probability between the true and the most competitive false label. To enhance the generalization ability of the architecture, L2-regularization (REG) is considered along with the maximum margin (MM) criterion in the learning process. To highlight cell features, this paper investigates the effectiveness of two generic high-pass filters: ideal high-pass filtering and the Laplacian of Gaussian (LOG) filtering. On both HEp-2 and Feulgen benchmark datasets, the t-SPN architecture learned based on the max-margin criterion with regularization produced the highest accuracy rate compared to other state-of-the-art algorithms that include convolutional neural network (CNN) based algorithms.

Here, we introduce a topology optimization framework based on PINNs that solves geometry detection problems without prior knowledge of the number or types of shapes. We allow for arbitrary solution topology by representing the geometry using a material density field that approaches binary values thanks to a novel eikonal regularization. We validate our framework by detecting the number, locations, and shapes of hidden voids and inclusions in linear and nonlinear elastic bodies using measurements of outer surface displacement from a single mechanical loading experiment.

        "abstract": "Deep neural networks have achieved promising results in automatic image captioning due to their effective representation learning and context-based content generation capabilities. As a prominent type of deep features used in many of the recent image captioning methods, the well-known bottomup features provide a detailed representation of different objects of the image in comparison with the feature maps directly extracted from the raw image. However, the lack of high-level semantic information about the relationships between these objects is an important drawback of bottom-up features, despite their expensive and resource-demanding extraction procedure. To take advantage of visual relationships in caption generation, this paper proposes a deep neural network architecture for image captioning based on fusing the visual relationships information extracted from an image's scene graph with the spatial feature maps of the image. A multi-modal reward function is then introduced for deep reinforcement learning of the proposed network using a combination of language and vision similarities in a common embedding space. The results of extensive experimentation on the MSCOCO dataset show the effectiveness of using visual relationships in the proposed captioning method. Moreover, the results clearly indicate that the proposed multi-modal reward in deep reinforcement learning leads to better model optimization, outperforming several state-of-the-art image captioning algorithms, while using light and easy to extract image features.

        "abstract": "The final step in secretion is membrane fusion facilitated by SNARE proteins that reside in opposite membranes. The formation of a trans-SNARE complex between one R and three Q coiled-coiled SNARE domains drives the final approach of the membranes providing the mechanical energy for fusion. Biological control of this mechanism is exerted by additional domains within some SNAREs. For example, the N-terminal Longin domain (LD) of R-SNAREs (also called Vesicle-associated membrane proteins, VAMPs) can fold back onto the SNARE domain blocking interaction with other cognate SNAREs. The LD may also determine the subcellular localization via interaction with other trafficking related proteins. Here, we provide cell-biological and genetic evidence that phosphorylation of the Tyrosine57 residue regulates the functionality of VAMP721. We found that an aspartate mutation mimics phosphorylation, leading to protein instability and subsequent degradation in lytic vacuoles. The mutant SNARE also fails to rescue the defects of vamp721vamp722 loss-of-function lines in spite of its wildtype-like localization within the secretory pathway and the ability to interact with cognate SNARE partners. Most importantly, it imposes a dominant negative phenotype interfering with root growth, normal secretion and cytokinesis in wildtype plants generating large aggregates that mainly contain secretory vesicles. Non-phosphorylatable VAMP721Y57F needs higher gene dosage to rescue double mutants in comparison to native VAMP721 underpinning that phosphorylation modulates SNARE function. We propose a model where a short-lived phosphorylation of Y57 serves as a regulatory step to control VAMP721 activity, favouring its open state and interaction with cognate partners to ultimately drive membrane fusion.",

Although transcriptional regulation is essential for SCW formation, little is known about the implication of post-transcriptional mechanisms in this process. Here we report that two bonafide RNA-binding proteins homologous to the animal translational regulator Musashi, MSIL2 and MSIL4, function redundantly to control SCW formation in Arabidopsis. MSIL2/4 interactomes are similar and enriched in proteins involved in mRNA binding and translational regulation. MSIL2/4 mutations alter SCW formation in the fibers, leading to a reduction in lignin deposition, and an increase of 4-O- glucuronoxylan methylation. In accordance, quantitative proteomics of stems reveal an overaccumulation of glucuronoxylan biosynthetic machinery, including GXM3, in the msil2/4 mutant stem. We showed that MSIL4 immunoprecipitates GXM mRNAs, suggesting a novel aspect of SCW regulation, linking translational control to the regulation of SCW biosynthesis genes.",

        "abstract": "Artemisia annua is an effective antimalarial medicinal crop. We have established anthocyanin-producing red cell cultures from this plant with the overexpression of Production of Anthocyanin Pigment 1 (PAP1) encoding a R2R3MYB transcription factor. To understand the molecular mechanism by which PAP1 activated the entire anthocyanin pathway, we mined the genomic sequences of A. annua and obtained eight promoters of the anthocyanin pathway genes. Sequence analysis identified four types of AC cis-elements from six promoters, the MYB response elements (MRE) bound by PAP1. In addition, six promoters were determined to have at least one G-Box cis-element. Eight promoters were cloned for activity analysis. Duel luciferase assays showed that PAP1 significantly enhanced the promoting activity of seven promoters, indicating that PAP1 turned on the biosynthesis of anthocyanins via the activation of these pathway gene expression. To understand how 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D), an auxin, regulates the PAP1-activated anthocyanin biosynthesis, five different concentrations (0, 0.05, 0.5, 2.5, and 5 M) were tested to characterize anthocyanin production and profiles. The resulting data showed that the concentrations tested decreased the fresh weight of callus growth, anthocyanin levels, and the production of anthocyanins per petri dish. HPLC-qTOF-MS/MS based profiling showed that these concentrations did not alter anthocyanin profiles. Real time RT-PCR was completed to characterize the expression PAP1 and four representative pathway genes. The results showed that the five concentrations reduced the expression levels of the constitutive PAP1 transgene and three pathway genes significantly and eliminated chalcone synthase gene in expression either significantly or slightly. These data indicate that the constitutive PAP1 expression depends on gradients added in the medium. Based on these findings, the regulation of 2,4-D is discussed for anthocyanin engineering in red cells of A. annua.  ConclusionPromoters of eight anthocyanin pathway genes were cloned. Four types of AC cis-elements were identified from six promoters and G-Box elements were also determined from six promoters. PAP1 enhanced the activity of eight promoters. 2,4-D downregulated the expression of the constitutive PAP1 transgene leading to the decrease the biosynthesis of anthocyanins.",

The alkaloids are synthesized in green organs (leaves, stems, and pods) and a subset of them is transported to the seeds during fruit development. The exact sites of biosynthesis and accumulation remain unknown, however mesophyll cells have been proposed as sources, and epidermal cells have been suggested as sinks. We examined the spatial localization of the alkaloids in biosynthetic organs of narrow-leafed lupin using mass spectrometry-based imaging (MSI). The alkaloids that accumulate in seeds (\"core\" alkaloids) were evenly distributed across tissues, however their esterified versions accumulated primarily in the epidermis. In addition, we generated a tissue-specific RNAseq dataset of biosynthetic organs using laser-capture microdissection. The dataset revealed that alkaloid biosynthetic genes are strongly expressed in the epidermis. To confirm the biosynthetic capacity of the leaf epidermis, we combined precursor feeding studies with mass spectrometry imaging, which showed that the lower epidermis is highly biosynthetic.

To elucidate the mechanisms that recalibrate cytoplasmic and apoplastic pH homeostasis, we conducted a comprehensive proteomic/phosphoproteomic inventory of plants subjected to transient exposure to acidic or alkaline pH, an approach that covered the majority of protein-coding genes of the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana. Our survey revealed a large set so far undocumented pHe-dependent and potentially pH-specific phospho-sites, indicative of extensive post-translational regulation of proteins involved in the acclimation to pHe. Changes in pHe altered both electrogenic H+ pumping via P-type ATPases and H+/anion co-transport processes, leading to massively altered net trans-plasma membrane translocation of H+ ions. In pH 7.5 plants, transport (but not the assimilation) of nitrogen via NRT2-type nitrate and AMT1- type ammonium transporters was induced, conceivably to increase the cytosolic H+ concentration. Exposure to acidic pH resulted in a marked repression of primary root elongation. No such cessation was observed in nrt2.1 mutants, suggesting a role of NRT2.1 in negatively regulating root growth in response to acidic pH. Sequestration of iron into the vacuole via phosphorylation and abundance of the vacuolar iron transporter VTL5 was inversely regulated in response to high and low pHe, presumptively in anticipation of changes in iron availability associated with alterations of pHe in the soil. A pH-dependent  phospho-switch was also observed for the ABC transporter PDR7, suggesting changes in activity and, possibly, substrate specificity. Unexpectedly, the effect of pHe was not restricted to roots and provoked pronounced changes in the leaf proteome. In both roots and shoots, the plant-specific TPLATE complex components AtEH1 and AtEH2 - essential for clathrin-mediated endocytosis - were differentially phosphorylated at multiple sites in response to pHe, indicating that the endocytic cargo protein trafficking is orchestrated by pHe.",

As plant cells are surrounded by walls, polarized cell shape and protein polarity in the plasma membrane are particularly important for normal physiology and development. We have identified WALLFLOWER (WFL), a transmembrane receptor kinase that is asymmetrically distributed at the inner face of epidermal cells and this localization is maintained independent of cell type. In epidermal hair (H) cells in the elongation and differentiation zones, WFL exhibits a dual polar localization, accumulating at the inner domain as well as at the root hair initiation domain (RHID). Furthermore, overexpression of WFL leads to a downward shift in root hair (RH) position suggesting WFL operates in a signaling pathway that functions across H cells to inform RH position. WFL asymmetric distribution and function is affected by deletion of the intracellular domains resulting in its mislocalization to the outer polar domain of H cells and exclusion from RHIDs and bulges. Thus, our results demonstrate that in epidermal H cells the WFL intracellular domains are required to direct its dual polar localization and influence RH position.

In this study, HMW leaf DNA samples were prepared to generate 21.6 Gb PacBio HiFi data, which was assembled into to a raw tetraploid genome assembly of 1.24 Gb using Canu and into a partially phased assembly of 564.8 Mb by Hifiasm. The N50 values were 1.28 Mb and 2.75 Mb, respectively, and the BUSCO completeness were all above 99%. Repeats were found to account for 27.35% of the genome. The k-mer analysis indicated that marama was likely to be an autotetraploid plant with an estimated haplotype genome size of only 277 Mb. The current assembly was aligned with the genome of Bauhinia variegata, the closest species to marama whose genome has been sequenced, with an overall alignment rate of only 20.36% indicating a significant divergence between the two. This is the first high-quality genome assembly of marama bean, albeit unphased and still fragmented. However, some of the long contigs, which can be close to half the chromosome length, can serve as good references for studying the genes underlying the traits of interest.

These approaches were applied at the genus level as well as within each of the three major clades within the genus to examine the variability in major axes of trait divergence in three independent species radiations.  Key ResultsMachine learning models were able to predict species identity from functional traits with high accuracy, and differences in functional trait importance were observed between the genus level and clade levels indicating different axes of phenotypic divergence.  ConclusionsApplying machine-learning approaches to identify divergent traits can provide insights into the predictability or repeatability of evolution through comparison of parallel diversification of clades within a genus.

        "abstract": "Identifying traits that exhibit improved drought resistance is highly important to cope with the challenges of predicted climate change. We investigated the response of state transition mutants to drought. Compared with the wild type, state transition mutants were less affected by drought. Photosynthetic parameters in leaves probed by chlorophyll fluorescence confirmed that mutants possess a more reduced plastoquinone (PQ) pool, as expected due to the absence of state transitions. Seedlings of the mutants showed an enhanced growth of the primary root and more lateral root formation. The photosystem II inhibitor 3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea, leading to an oxidized PQ pool, inhibited primary root growth in wild type and mutants, while the cytochrome b6f complex inhibitor 2,5-dibromo-3-methyl-6-isopropylbenzoquinone, leading to a reduced PQ pool, stimulated root growth. A more reduced state of the PQ pool was associated with a slight but significant increase in singlet oxygen production. Singlet oxygen may trigger a, yet unknown, signaling cascade promoting root growth. We propose that photosynthetic mutants with a deregulated ratio of photosystem II to photosystem I activity can provide a novel path for improving crop drought resistance.

CEPs process the cell-wall scaffolding EXTENSIN proteins (EXTs), which regulate de novo cell wall formation and cell expansion. Since CEPs are able to cleave EXTs and EXT-related proteins, acting as cell wall-weakening agents, they may play a role in cell elongation. Arabidopsis thaliana genome encodes three CEPs (AtCPE1-AtCEP3). Here we report that the three Arabidopsis CEPs, AtCEP1-AtCEP, are highly expressed in root-hair cell files. Single mutants have no evident root-hair phenotype, but atcep1-3 atcep3-2 and atcep1-3 atcep2-2 double mutants have longer root hairs (RHs) than wild type (Wt) plants, suggesting that expression of AtCEPs in root trichoblasts restrains polar elongation of the RH. We provide evidence that the transcription factor NAC1 activates AtCEPs expression in roots to limit RH length. Chromatin immunoprecipitation indicates that NAC1 binds the promoter of AtCEP2 and may directly regulate its expression. Indeed, Inducible NAC1 overexpression increases AtCEP1 and AtCEP2 transcript levels in roots and leads to reduced RH growth while the loss of function nac1-2 mutation reduces AtCEP1-AtCEP3 gene expression and enhances RH growth. Likewise, expression of a dominant chimeric NAC1-SRDX repressor construct leads to increased RH length. Finally, we show that RH cell walls in the atcep1-1 atcep3-2 double mutant have reduced levels of EXT secretion/insolubilization, suggesting that the defects in RH elongation are linked to alterations in EXT processing and accumulation. Taken together, our results support the involvement of the NAC1-AtCEP regulatory module in controlling RH polar growth through EXT processing and insolubilization at the cell wall.",

Recent work has begun to use co-transcriptomic studies to shed light on this bidirectional flow, but it is unclear how plastic the co-transcriptome is in response to genetic variation in both the host and pathogen. To study co-transcriptome plasticity, we conducted transcriptomics using natural genetic variation in the pathogen, Botrytis cinerea, and large effect genetic variation abolishing defense signaling pathways within the host, Arabidopsis thaliana. We show that genetic variation in the pathogen has a greater influence on the co-transcriptome than mutations that abolish defense signaling pathways in the host. Genome wide association mapping using the pathogens genetic variation and both organisms transcriptomes allowed an assessment of how the pathogen modulates plasticity in response to the host. This showed that the differences in both organisms responses were linked to trans-eQTL hotspots within the pathogens genome. These hotspots control gene sets in either the host or pathogen and show differential allele sensitivity to the hosts genetic variation rather than qualitative host specificity. Interestingly, nearly all the trans-eQTL hotspots were unique to the host or pathogen transcriptomes. In this system of differential plasticity, the pathogen mediates the shift in the co-transcriptome more than the host.",

Root growth places a critical role in the determination of this balance. Root growth and function responses to temperature can determine the strength of roots as sinks but also influence the crops ability to uptake water and nutrients. Surprisingly, this behavior has not been studied in maize since the middle of the last century, and the genetic determinants are unknown. Low temperatures often recorded in deep soil layers limit root growth and soil exploration and may constitute a bottleneck towards increasing drought tolerance, nitrogen recovery, sequestration of carbon and productivity in maize. High throughput phenotyping (HTP) systems were developed to investigate these responses and to examine genetic variability therein across diverse maize germplasm. Here we show that there is: 1) genetic variation of root growth under low temperature and below 10{degrees}C, and 2) genotypic variation in water transport under low temperature. Using simulation, we demonstrate that the measured variation for both traits contribute to drought tolerance and explain important components of yield variation in the US corn-belt.

However, the mechanism by which AXR3 regulates cell elongation is not fully understood. Here we show that the inducible expression of AXR3-1 in the Arabidopsis thaliana root triggers excessive cell elongation that is followed by growth arrest of the root. We exploited this effect to reveal the underlying molecular mechanism of AXR3 action. We show that AXR3-1 acts exclusively in the nucleus where it interferes with the nuclear auxin transcriptional pathway, while the rapid cytoplasmic auxin root growth response is not affected. The analysis of the transcriptome of the induced AXR3-1 roots revealed changes in phytohormone perception and homeostasis. We show that the accumulation of AXR3-1 disturbs auxin homeostasis which leads to excessive auxin accumulation. At the same time, the reaction of the AXR3-1 roots to gibberellin is altered.

Evolution can serve as our guide, revealing high-priority genes with deeply conserved roles. Indeed, GRASSY TILLERS1 (GT1), SIX-ROWED SPIKE1 (VRS1), and their homologs have repeatedly been targets of selection in domestication and evolution. This repeated selection may be because these genes have an ancient, conserved role in regulating growth repression. To test this, we determined the roles of GT1 and VRS1 homologs in maize (Zea mays) and the distantly related grass brachypodium (Brachypodium distachyon) using CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing and mutant analysis. GT1 and VRS1 have roles in floral development in maize and barley, respectively. Grass flowers are borne in branching structures called spikelets. In maize spikelets, carpels are suppressed in half of all initiated ear flowers. These spikelets can only produce single grains. We show that gt1; vrs1-like1 (vrl1) mutants have derepressed carpels in ear flowers. Importantly, these plants can produce two grains per spikelet. In brachypodium, bdgt1; bdvrl1 mutants have more branches, spikelets, and flowers than wildtype plants, indicating conserved roles for GT1 and VRS1 homologs in growth suppression. Indeed, maize GT1 can suppress growth in Arabidopsis thaliana, separated from the grasses by ca. 160 million years of evolution.

RipE1 is an effector conserved across RSSC isolated from diverse plant species and triggers immune responses in the model Solanaceae Nicotiana benthamiana.

Using a methodology that allows synchronous inoculation and growth of over 100 plants in a single media container, we harvested the same segment of each root responding to rhizobia in the initial inoculation over a time course, collected individual tissues from these segments with laser capture microdissection, and created and sequenced RNA libraries generated from these tissues. We demonstrate the utility of the resource by examining the expression patterns of a set of genes induced very early in nodule signaling, as well as two gene families (CLE peptides and nodule specific PLAT-domain proteins) and show that despite similar whole root expression patterns, there are tissue differences in expression between the genes. Using a rhizobial response data set generated from transcriptomics on intact root segments, we also examined differential temporal expression patterns and determined that, after nodule tissue, the epidermis and cortical cells contained the most temporally patterned genes. We circumscribed gene lists for each time and tissue examined and developed an expression pattern visualization tool. Finally, we explored transcriptomic differences between the inner cortical cells that become nodules and those that do not, confirming that the expression of ACC synthases distinguishes inner cortical cells that become nodules and provide and describe potential downstream genes involved in early nodule cell division.",

This method called glycome profiling (glycomics) revealed global differences in non-cellulosic cell wall epitopes in Arabidopsis thaliana root extracts recovered from RNA purification columns between seedlings grown on the International Space Station-based Vegetable Production System and paired ground (1-g) controls. Immunohistochemistry on 11-day-old seedling primary root sections showed that ten of twenty-two mAbs that exhibited spaceflight-induced increases in binding through glycomics, labeled space-grown roots more intensely than those from the ground. The ten mAbs recognized xyloglucan, xylan, and arabinogalactan epitopes. Notably, three xylem-enriched unsubstituted xylan backbone epitopes were more intensely labeled in space-grown roots than in ground-grown roots, suggesting that the spaceflight environment accelerated root secondary cell wall formation. This study highlights the feasibility of glycomics for high-throughput evaluation of cell wall glycans using only root high alkaline extracts from RNA purification columns, and subsequent validation of these results by immunohistochemistry. This approach will benefit plant space biological studies because it extends the analyses possible from the limited amounts of samples returned from spaceflight and help uncover microgravity-induced tissue-specific changes in plant cell walls.",

Plants display intraspecific variation in tolerance limits for root-feeding nematodes. Although disease tolerance has been recognised as a distinct trait in biotic interactions of mainly crops, we lack mechanistic insights. Progress is hampered by difficulties in quantification and laborious screening methods. We turned to the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana, since it offers extensive resources to study the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying nematode-plant interactions. Through imaging of tolerance-related parameters the green canopy area was identified as an accessible and robust measure for assessing damage due to cyst nematode infection. Subsequently, a high-throughput phenotyping platform simultaneously measuring the green canopy area growth of 960 A. thaliana plants was developed. This platform can accurately measure cyst- and root-knot nematode tolerance limits in A. thaliana through classical modelling of tolerance limits. Furthermore, real-time monitoring provided data for a novel view of tolerance, identifying a compensatory growth response. These findings show that our phenotyping platform will enable further studies into a mechanistic understanding of tolerance to below-ground biotic stress.

In contrast, proteins with roles in defense are expected to evolve rapidly, in molecular arms-races with pathogens. However, some gene families include both developmental and defense genes. In these families, does the tempo and mode of evolution differ between developmental and defense genes, despite shared ancestry and structure? The leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinase (LRR-RLKs) protein family includes many members with roles in plant development and defense, thus providing an ideal system for answering this question. LRR-RLKs are receptors that traverse plasma membranes. LRR domains bind extracellular ligands, RLK domains initiate intracellular signaling cascades in response to ligand binding. In LRR-RLKs with roles in defense, LRR domains evolve faster than RLK domains. To determine whether this asymmetry extends to developmental LRR-RLKs, we assessed evolutionary rates and tested for selection acting on eleven clades of LRR-RLK proteins, using deeply sampled protein trees. To assess functional evolution, we performed heterologous complementation assays using Arabidopsis thaliana (arabidopsis) LRR-RLK mutants. We found that the LRR domains of developmental LRR-RLK proteins evolved faster than their cognate RLK domains. LRR-RLKs with roles in development and defense had strikingly similar patterns of molecular evolution. Heterologous transformation experiments revealed that the evolution of developmental LRR-RLKs likely involves multiple mechanisms, including changes to cis-regulation, coding sequence evolution, and escape from adaptive conflict. Our results indicate similar evolutionary pressures acting on developmental and defense signaling proteins, despite divergent organismal functions. In addition, deep understanding of the molecular evolution of developmental receptors can help guide targeted genome engineering in agriculture.",

        "abstract": "Plastid genomes (plastomes) have long been recognized as highly conserved in their overall structure, size, gene arrangement and content among land plants. However, recent studies have shown that some lineages present unusual variations in some of these features. Members of the cactus family are one of these lineages, with distinct plastome structures reported across disparate lineages including gene losses, inversions, boundary movements, or loss of the canonical inverted repeat (IR) region. Here, we further investigated plastome features of the tribe Opuntieae, the remarkable prickly pear cacti, which represent a diverse and important lineage of Cactaceae. We assembled the plastome of 43 species, representing a comprehensive sampling of the tribe including all seven genera. Plastomes varied considerably in length from 121 kbp to 162 kbp, with striking differences in the content and size of the IR region (contraction and expansion events), including the lack of the canonical IR in some lineages, and the pseudogenization or loss of some genes. Overall, nine different types of plastomes were reported deviating in the presence of the IR region or the genes contained in the IR. Plastomes sequences resolved phylogenetic relationships within major clades of Opuntieae but presented some contentious nodes depending on the data set analyzed (e.g., whole plastome vs. genes only). Incongruence analyses revealed that few plastome regions are supporting the most likely topology, while disputing topologies are driven by a handful of plastome markers, which may be the result of hard recalcitrant nodes in the phylogeny or by the lack of phylogenetic signal in certain markers. Our study reveals a dynamic nature of plastome evolution across closely related lineages, shedding light on peculiar features of cactus plastomes. Variation of plastome types across Opuntieae is remarkable in size, structure, and content, and can be important for the recognition of species in some major clades. Unraveling connections between the causes of plastome variation and the consequences on species biology, ecology, diversification, and adaptation, is a promising endeavor.",

In plants, PCD is often an essential component of normal development and can also mediate responses to abiotic and biotic stress stimuli. However, studying the transcriptional regulation of this fundamental process is hindered by difficulties in sampling small groups of cells undergoing PCD that are often buried within the bulk of living plant tissue. We addressed this challenge by using RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) of Arabidopsis thaliana suspension cells, a system that allows precise monitoring of PCD activation and progression. The use of three PCD-inducing treatments (salicylic acid, heat and critical dilution), in combination with three cell death modulators (3- methyladenine, lanthanum chloride and conditioned medium), allowed isolation of candidate  core and stimuli-specific PCD genes, inference of underlying gene regulatory networks and identification of putative transcriptional regulators. This analysis underscored cell cycle disturbance and the repression of both pro-survival stress responses and mitochondrial retrograde signalling as key elements of the PCD-associated transcriptional signature in plants. Further, phenotyping of twenty Arabidopsis T-DNA insertion mutants in selected candidate genes confirmed a role for several in PCD and stress tolerance regulation, and validated the potential of these generated resources to identify novel genes involved in plant PCD pathways and/or stress tolerance in plants.",

Single-cell transcriptomes from protoplasts of more than 2750 Arabidopsis thaliana root cells were obtained. Plotting the single-cell transcriptomes via t-SNE projections yielded six major cell clusters including quiescent cells (QC), endodermis, cortex, columella, trichoblast (root-hair), and root cap. The maximum number of most significantly upregulated genes were determined in columella under 1 mM B and in endodermis under 2 mM B condition. Additionally, the maximum number of most significantly upregulated genes under 3 mM B and 5 mM B conditions was determined in the root cap, implying a critical role against severe B toxicity conditions. We also showed that these upregulated genes are highly correlated with \"glutathione metabolism\" in columella and \"carbon metabolism\" in root cap.

However, the identifying assumptions required by an IV design are demanding, and it remains challenging for researchers to assess their validity. In this paper, we replicate 67 papers published in three top journals in political science during 2010-2022 and identify several troubling patterns. First, researchers often overestimate the strength of their IVs due to non-i.i.d. errors, such as a clustering structure. Second, the most commonly used t-test for the two-stage-least-squares (2SLS) estimates often severely underestimates uncertainty. Using more robust inferential methods, we find that around 19-30% of the 2SLS estimates in our sample are underpowered. Third, in the majority of the replicated studies, the 2SLS estimates are much larger than the ordinary-least-squares estimates, and their ratio is negatively correlated with the strength of the IVs in studies where the IVs are not experimentally generated, suggesting potential violations of unconfoundedness or the exclusion restriction. To help researchers avoid these pitfalls, we provide a checklist for better practice.",

In this paper, we provide a necessary and sufficient condition, referred to as Restricted Local Non-surjectivity (RLN), for the existence of such orthogonal moments to conduct robust inference on parameters of interest in regular semiparametric models. Importantly, RLN does not require identification of the parameters of interest or identification of the nuisance parameters. Thus, orthogonal moments exist under rather general conditions. However, for orthogonal moments to be informative for inference, the efficient Fisher Information matrix for the parameter must be non-zero (though possibly singular). We use these results to characterize the existence of orthogonal moments in a class of models with Unobserved Heterogeneity (UH), and to clarify the important role played by the support of UH for such characterization. Our results deliver functional differencing moments as a special case, and they also extend them to general functionals of UH.

While local linear regressions have been popular in settings where the treatment status is completely described by one running variable, they do not easily generalize to empirical applications involving multiple treatment assignment rules. In practice, the multivariate problem is usually reduced to a univariate one where using local linear regressions is suitable. Instead, we propose a forest-based estimator that can flexibly model multivariate scores, where we build two honest forests in the sense of Wager and Athey (2018) on both sides of the treatment boundary. This estimator is asymptotically normal and sidesteps the pitfalls of running local linear regressions in higher dimensions. In simulations, we find our proposed estimator outperforms local linear regressions in multivariate designs and is competitive against the minimax-optimal estimator of Imbens and Wager (2019). The implementation of this estimator is simple, can readily accommodate any (fixed) number of running variables, and does not require estimating any nuisance parameters of the data generating process.",

We consider two cases: (1) estimation when no dynamic model for the factors is specified (Bai and Li, 2016); (2) estimation based on the Kalman smoother and the Expectation Maximization algorithm thus allowing to model explicitly the factor dynamics (Doz et al., 2012). Our interest is in approximate factor models, i.e., when we allow for the idiosyncratic components to be mildly cross-sectionally, as well as serially, correlated. Although such setting apparently makes estimation harder, we show, in fact, that factor models do not suffer of the curse of dimensionality problem, but instead they enjoy a blessing of dimensionality property. In particular, we show that if the cross-sectional dimension of the data, $N$, grows to infinity, then: (i) identification of the model is still possible, (ii) the mis-specification error due to the use of an exact factor model log-likelihood vanishes. Moreover, if we let also the sample size, $T$, grow to infinity, we can also consistently estimate all parameters of the model and make inference. The same is true for estimation of the latent factors which can be carried out by weighted least-squares, linear projection, or Kalman filtering/smoothing.

        "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2204.07191",
        "abstract": "We consider the disclosure problem of a sender who wants to use hard evidence to persuade a receiver towards higher actions. When the receiver hopes to make inferences based on the distribution of the data, the sender has an incentive to drop observations to mimic the distributions observed under better states. We use a continuum model to predict optimal play when datasets are large and find that, in the big-data limit, it is optimal for senders to play an imitation strategy, under which they submit evidence imitating the natural distribution under some desirable target state. Relative to full information, the partial pooling equilibrium with voluntary disclosure generates a loss in welfare to senders who either have little data or a favorable state, who optimally disclose their full dataset, but a benefit to senders with access to large datasets, who can profitably drop observations under low states.",

        "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.09176",
        "abstract": "Conditional credit risk of a current loan is understudied. Using large-sample statistics and asset-level consumer automobile asset-backed security data, we find default risk conditional on survival eventually converges for borrowers in disparate credit risk bands, a phenomenon we call credit risk convergence. We conservatively estimate that borrowers forwent $1,212 - $2,327 in savings through delayed prepayment and find the surprising result that current lower risk borrowers behave less efficiently than current higher risk borrowers. We also present visual evidence prepayments rose with used auto values and economic stimulus rather than financial acumen. Our results are robust to various sensitivity tests.",

        "title": "Minimum Wage Pass-through to Wholesale and Retail Prices: Evidence from Cannabis Scanner Data.",
        "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.10367",
        "abstract": "A growing empirical literature finds that firms pass the cost of minimum wage hikes onto consumers via higher retail prices. Yet, little is known about minimum wage effects on wholesale prices and whether retailers face a wholesale cost shock in addition to the labor cost shock. I exploit the unique market structure of Washington state's legal recreational cannabis industry to investigate minimum wage pass-through to wholesale and retail prices. In a dynamic difference-in-differences framework, I utilize scanner data on $6 billion of transactions across the supply chain and leverage geographic variation in firms' minimum wage exposure across six minimum wage hikes between 2018 and 2021. When ignoring wholesale cost effects, I find retail pass-through elasticities consistent with existing literature--yet retail pass-through elasticities more than double once wholesale cost effects are accounted for. Retail markups do not adjust to the wholesale cost shock, indicating a full pass-through of the wholesale cost shock to retail prices. The results suggest that previous research may underestimate the impact of minimum wage increases on retail prices. This paper highlights the importance of analyzing the entire supply chain when evaluating the product market effects of minimum wage hikes.",

        "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.10889",
        "abstract": "We introduce the notion of a multidimensional hybrid preference domain on a (finite) set of alternatives that is a Cartesian product of finitely many components. We study strategy-proof rules on this domain and show that every such rule can be decomposed into component-wise strategy proof rules. More importantly, we show that under a suitable ``richness'' condition, every domain of preferences that reconciles decomposability of rules with strategy-proofness must be a multidimensional hybrid domain. We finally identify an intuitive weakening of separability that explains how a multidimensional hybrid domain may arise in a public goods provision model.",
