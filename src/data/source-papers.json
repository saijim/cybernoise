        "abstract": "The widespread application of multimodal machine learning models like GPT-4 has revolutionized various research fields including computer vision and natural language processing. However, its implementation in materials informatics remains underexplored, despite the presence of materials data across diverse modalities, such as composition and structure. The effectiveness of machine learning models trained on large calculated datasets depends on the accuracy of calculations, while experimental datasets often have limited data availability and incomplete information. This paper introduces a novel approach to multimodal machine learning in materials science via composition-structure bimodal learning. The proposed COmposition-Structure Bimodal Network (COSNet) is designed to enhance learning and predictions of experimentally measured materials properties that have incomplete structure information. Bimodal learning significantly reduces prediction errors across distinct materials properties including Li conductivity in solid electrolyte, band gap, refractive index, dielectric constant, energy, and magnetic moment, surpassing composition-only learning methods. Furthermore, we identified that data augmentation based on modal availability plays a pivotal role in the success of bimodal learning.",

A framework is proposed to represent and reason about penalties in plans, and an algorithm is proposed to penalize an agent's actions based on their level of compliance with respect to authorization and obligation policies. Being aware of penalties an agent can choose a plan with a minimal total penalty, unless there is an emergency goal like saving a human's life. The paper concludes that this framework can reprimand insubordinate agents.",

However, the problem of explainability cannot be exhaustively solved in the abstract, as there is no single approach that can be universally applied to generate adequate explanations for any given AI system, and this is especially true in the arts. In this position paper, we propose an Explanatory Pragmatism (EP) framework for XAI in music performance, emphasising the importance of context and audience in the development of explainability requirements. By tailoring explanations to specific audiences and continuously refining them based on feedback, EP offers a promising direction for enhancing the transparency and interpretability of AI systems in broad artistic applications and more specifically to music performance.",

        "abstract": "Deep reinforcement learning agents need to be trained over millions of episodes to decently solve navigation tasks grounded to instructions. Furthermore, their ability to generalize to novel combinations of instructions is unclear. Interestingly however, children can decompose language-based instructions and navigate to the referred object, even if they have not seen the combination of queries prior. Hence, we created three 3D environments to investigate how deep RL agents learn and compose color-shape based combinatorial instructions to solve novel combinations in a spatial navigation task. First, we explore if agents can perform compositional learning, and whether they can leverage on frozen text encoders (e.g. CLIP, BERT) to learn word combinations in fewer episodes. Next, we demonstrate that when agents are pretrained on the shape or color concepts separately, they show a 20 times decrease in training episodes needed to solve unseen combinations of instructions. Lastly, we show that agents pretrained on concept and compositional learning achieve significantly higher reward when evaluated zero-shot on novel color-shape1-shape2 visual object combinations. Overall, our results highlight the foundations needed to increase an agent's proficiency in composing word groups through reinforcement learning and its ability for zero-shot generalization to new combinations.",

        "abstract": "Gradient inversion attacks are an ubiquitous threat in federated learning as they exploit gradient leakage to reconstruct supposedly private training data. Recent work has proposed to prevent gradient leakage without loss of model utility by incorporating a PRivacy EnhanCing mODulE (PRECODE) based on variational modeling. Without further analysis, it was shown that PRECODE successfully protects against gradient inversion attacks. In this paper, we make multiple contributions. First, we investigate the effect of PRECODE on gradient inversion attacks to reveal its underlying working principle. We show that variational modeling introduces stochasticity into the gradients of PRECODE and the subsequent layers in a neural network. The stochastic gradients of these layers prevent iterative gradient inversion attacks from converging. Second, we formulate an attack that disables the privacy preserving effect of PRECODE by purposefully omitting stochastic gradients during attack optimization. To preserve the privacy preserving effect of PRECODE, our analysis reveals that variational modeling must be placed early in the network. However, early placement of PRECODE is typically not feasible due to reduced model utility and the exploding number of additional model parameters. Therefore, as a third contribution, we propose a novel privacy module -- the Convolutional Variational Bottleneck (CVB) -- that can be placed early in a neural network without suffering from these drawbacks. We conduct an extensive empirical study on three seminal model architectures and six image classification datasets. We find that all architectures are susceptible to gradient leakage attacks, which can be prevented by our proposed CVB. Compared to PRECODE, we show that our novel privacy module requires fewer trainable parameters, and thus computational and communication costs, to effectively preserve privacy.",

        "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.04522",
        "abstract": "Artificial neural networks have revolutionized machine learning in recent years, but a complete theoretical framework for their learning process is still lacking. Substantial progress has been made for infinitely wide networks. In this regime, two disparate theoretical frameworks have been used, in which the network's output is described using kernels: one framework is based on the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) which assumes linearized gradient descent dynamics, while the Neural Network Gaussian Process (NNGP) kernel assumes a Bayesian framework. However, the relation between these two frameworks has remained elusive. This work unifies these two distinct theories using a Markov proximal learning model for learning dynamics in an ensemble of randomly initialized infinitely wide deep networks. We derive an exact analytical expression for the network input-output function during and after learning, and introduce a new time-dependent Neural Dynamical Kernel (NDK) from which both NTK and NNGP kernels can be derived. We identify two learning phases characterized by different time scales: gradient-driven and diffusive learning. In the initial gradient-driven learning phase, the dynamics is dominated by deterministic gradient descent, and is described by the NTK theory. This phase is followed by the diffusive learning stage, during which the network parameters sample the solution space, ultimately approaching the equilibrium distribution corresponding to NNGP. Combined with numerical evaluations on synthetic and benchmark datasets, we provide novel insights into the different roles of initialization, regularization, and network depth, as well as phenomena such as early stopping and representational drift. This work closes the gap between the NTK and NNGP theories, providing a comprehensive framework for understanding the learning process of deep neural networks in the infinite width limit.",

        "abstract": "Graph structured data are widely existed and applied in the real-world applications, while it is a challenge to handling these diverse data and learning tasks on graph in an efficient manner. When facing the complicated graph learning tasks, experts have designed diverse Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) in recent years. They have also implemented AutoML in Graph, also known as AutoGraph, to automatically generate data-specific solutions. Despite their success, they encounter limitations in (1) managing diverse learning tasks at various levels, (2) dealing with different procedures in graph learning beyond architecture design, and (3) the huge requirements on the prior knowledge when using AutoGraph. In this paper, we propose to use Large Language Models (LLMs) as autonomous agents to simplify the learning process on diverse real-world graphs. Specifically, in response to a user request which may contain varying data and learning targets at the node, edge, or graph levels, the complex graph learning task is decomposed into three components following the agent planning, namely, detecting the learning intent, configuring solutions based on AutoGraph, and generating a response. The AutoGraph agents manage crucial procedures in automated graph learning, including data-processing, AutoML configuration, searching architectures, and hyper-parameter fine-tuning. With these agents, those components are processed by decomposing and completing step by step, thereby generating a solution for the given data automatically, regardless of the learning task on node or graph. The proposed method is dubbed Auto$^2$Graph, and the comparable performance on different datasets and learning tasks. Its effectiveness is demonstrated by its comparable performance on different datasets and learning tasks, as well as the human-like decisions made by the agents.",

We conducted ablation experiments to assess the performance of individual feature extractors, fusion of visual information, and fusion of both visual and audio information. Moreover, we experimented with internal and external cross-validation. Our results demonstrate that the fusion of audio and visual information through late decision fusion improves detection performance, making it a promising tool for fall prevention and mitigation.",

We tested the ability of four pre-trained STS models to screen thousands of symptom description pairs for related content - a challenging task typically requiring expert panels. Models were tasked to predict symptom severity across four different inventories for 6,607 participants drawn from 16 international data sources. The STS approach achieved 74.8% accuracy across five tasks, outperforming other models tested.

To enable robots to capture the underlying distribution of object properties necessary for generalising learnt manipulation tasks to unseen objects, existing Learning from Demonstration (LfD) approaches require a large number of costly human demonstrations. Our proposed semi-supervised LfD approach decouples the learnt model into an haptic representation encoder and a motion generation decoder. This enables us to pre-train the first using large amount of unsupervised data, easily accessible, while using few-shot LfD to train the second, leveraging the benefits of learning skills from humans. We validate the approach on the wiping task using sponges with different stiffness and surface friction. Our results demonstrate that pre-training significantly improves the ability of the LfD model to recognise physical properties and generate desired wiping motions for unseen sponges, outperforming the LfD method without pre-training. We validate the motion generated by our semi-supervised LfD model on the physical robot hardware using the KUKA iiwa robot arm. We also validate that the haptic representation encoder, pre-trained in simulation, captures the properties of real objects, explaining its contribution to improving the generalisation of the downstream task.",

To evaluate these alternatives, here we benchmarked vision transformers (ViTs) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs), initialized with varied upstream pre-training approaches. These methods were then adapted to three unique downstream neuroimaging tasks with a range of difficulty: Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD) classification, \"brain age\" prediction. Experimental tests led to the following key observations: 1. Pre-training improved performance across all tasks including a boost of 7.4% for AD classification and 4.6% for PD classification for the ViT and 19.1% for PD classification and reduction in brain age prediction error by 1.26 years for CNNs, 2. Pre-training on large-scale video or synthetic MRI data boosted performance of ViTs, 3. CNNs were robust in limited-data settings, and in-domain pretraining enhanced their performances, 4.

Based on these connections, we propose a new learning paradigm called FIAT that fuses the best of these paradigms together, enabling prompt-engineered instructions and chain-of-thought reasoning with the very largest models while also using similar methods to perform parameter updates on a modestly-sized LLM with parameter-efficient tuning. We evaluate FIAT's effectiveness on a variety of multilingual tasks and observe that FIAT performs better than both ICL and fine-tuning at scales ranging from 100-10,000 training examples. We hope that FIAT provides a practical way of harnessing the full potential of LLMs without needing to make a hard choice between learning paradigms.",

Specifically, CEMSP constrains changing values of abnormal features with the help of their semantically meaningful normal ranges. For efficiency, we model the problem as a Boolean satisfiability problem to modify as few features as possible. Additionally, CEMSP is a general framework and can easily accommodate more practical requirements, e.g., casualty and actionability. Compared to existing methods, we conduct comprehensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets to demonstrate that our method provides more robust explanations while preserving flexibility.",

Recently, the emergence of In-Context Learning (ICL) capabilities in Large Language Models (LLMs) provides a simple and training-free semantic parsing paradigm for KBQA: Given a small number of questions and their labeled logical forms as demo examples, LLMs can understand the task intent and generate the logic form for a new question. However, current powerful LLMs have little exposure to logic forms during pre-training, resulting in a high format error rate. To solve this problem, we propose a code-style in-context learning method for KBQA, which converts the generation process of unfamiliar logical form into the more familiar code generation process for LLMs. Experimental results on three mainstream datasets show that our method dramatically mitigated the formatting error problem in generating logic forms while realizing a new SOTA on WebQSP, GrailQA, and GraphQ under the few-shot setting.",

Moreover, the feedforward control exhibits a more proactive response, leading to enhanced performance. The exoskeleton used in the experiments is lightweight and comprises 4 Degrees of Freedom, closely mimicking human upper body kinematics and three-dimensional range of motion.

A2CR consists of three interconnected networks: the Policy Network, the Value Network, and the Reasoner Network. By predefining and classifying the underlying purpose of the actor's actions, A2CR automatically generates a more comprehensive and interpretable paradigm for understanding the agent's decision-making process. It offers a range of functionalities such as purpose-based saliency, early failure detection, and model supervision, thereby promoting responsible and trustworthy RL. Evaluations conducted in action-rich Super Mario Bros environments yield intriguing findings: Reasoner-predicted label proportions decrease for ``Breakout\" and increase for ``Hovering\" as the exploration level of the RL algorithm intensifies.

As such, most reproducing efforts are spent on manual implementation based on the publications, which is both time and labor consuming and error-prone.

We consider the echo index for a nonautonomous system that switches between a finite set of maps, where we assume that each map possesses a finite set of hyperbolic equilibrium attractors. We find the minimum and maximum repetitions of each map are crucial for the resulting echo index. Casting our theoretical findings in the RNN computing framework, we obtain that for small amplitude forcing the echo index corresponds to the number of attractors for the input-free system, while for large amplitude forcing, the echo index reduces to one. The intermediate regime is the most interesting; in this region the echo index depends not just on the amplitude of forcing but also on more subtle properties of the input.",

These methods require sufficiently large labeled data for stable learning, however acquiring high-quality labeled time series data can be costly and potentially infeasible. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have achieved great success in enhancing unsupervised and semi-supervised learning. Nonetheless, to our best knowledge, it remains unclear how effectively GANs can serve as a general-purpose solution to learn representations for time series recognition, i.e., classification and clustering. The above considerations inspire us to introduce a Time-series Convolutional GAN (TCGAN). TCGAN learns by playing an adversarial game between two one-dimensional CNNs (i.e., a generator and a discriminator) in the absence of label information. Parts of the trained TCGAN are then reused to construct a representation encoder to empower linear recognition methods. We conducted comprehensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets. The results demonstrate that TCGAN is faster and more accurate than existing time-series GANs. The learned representations enable simple classification and clustering methods to achieve superior and stable performance. Furthermore, TCGAN retains high efficacy in scenarios with few-labeled and imbalanced-labeled data. Our work provides a promising path to effectively utilize abundant unlabeled time series data.",

        "abstract": "The prediction of wind in terms of both wind speed and direction, which has a crucial impact on many real-world applications like aviation and wind power generation, is extremely challenging due to the high stochasticity and complicated correlation in the weather data. Existing methods typically focus on a sub-set of influential factors and thus lack a systematic treatment of the problem. In addition, fine-grained forecasting is essential for efficient industry operations, but has been less attended in the literature. In this work, we propose a novel data-driven model, Multi-Horizon SpatioTemporal Network (MHSTN), generally for accurate and efficient fine-grained wind prediction. MHSTN integrates multiple deep neural networks targeting different factors in a sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) backbone to effectively extract features from various data sources and produce multi-horizon predictions for all sites within a given region. MHSTN is composed of four major modules. First, a temporal module fuses coarse-grained forecasts derived by Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) and historical on-site observation data at stations so as to leverage both global and local atmospheric information. Second, a spatial module exploits spatial correlation by modeling the joint representation of all stations. Third, an ensemble module weighs the above two modules for final predictions. Furthermore, a covariate selection module automatically choose influential meteorological variables as initial input. MHSTN is already integrated into the scheduling platform of one of the busiest international airports of China.

However, current approaches, relying on full Navier-Stokes equations, are impractical for ultrafast Doppler ultrasound, the state-of-the-art technique for depiction of complex blood flow dynamics \\emph{in vivo} through acquired thousands of frames (or, timestamps) per second. In this article, we first propose a novel training framework of PINN for solving Navier-Stokes equations by discretizing Navier-Stokes equations into steady state and sequentially solving steady-state Navier-Stokes equations with transfer learning. The novel training framework is coined as SeqPINN. Upon the success of SeqPINN, we adopt the idea of averaged constant stochastic gradient descent (SGD) as initialization and propose a parallel training scheme for all timestamps. To ensure an initialization that generalizes well, we borrow the concept of Stochastic Weight Averaging Gaussian to perform uncertainty estimation as an indicator of generalizability of the initialization. This algorithm, named SP-PINN, further expedites training of PINN while achieving comparable accuracy with SeqPINN. Finite-element simulations and \\emph{in vitro} phantoms of single-branch and trifurcate blood vessels are used to evaluate the performance of SeqPINN and SP-PINN. Results show that both SeqPINN and SP-PINN are manyfold faster than the original design of PINN, while respectively achieving Root Mean Square Errors (RMSEs) of 1.01 cm/s and 1.26 cm/s on the straight vessel and 1.91 cm/s and 2.56 cm/s on the trifurcate blood vessel when recovering blood flow velocities.",

In this paper, we propose a new method called Reliable-Region-Based Conformal Prediction (RR-CP), which aims to impose a stronger statistical guarantee so that the user-specified error rate (e.g., 0.5\\%) can be achieved in the test time, and under this constraint, the size of the prediction set is optimized (to be small). We consider a small prediction set size an important measure only when the user-specified error rate is achieved. Experiments on five public datasets show that our RR-CP performs well: with a reasonably small-sized prediction set, it achieves the user-specified error rate (e.g., 0.5\\%) significantly more frequently than exiting CP methods.",

To protect the copyright of DNNs, backdoor-based ownership verification becomes popular recently, in which the model owner can watermark the model by embedding a specific backdoor behavior before releasing it. The defenders (usually the model owners) can identify whether a suspicious third-party model is ``stolen'' from them based on the presence of the behavior. Unfortunately, these watermarks are proven to be vulnerable to removal attacks even like fine-tuning. To further explore this vulnerability, we investigate the parameter space and find there exist many watermark-removed models in the vicinity of the watermarked one, which may be easily used by removal attacks. Inspired by this finding, we propose a mini-max formulation to find these watermark-removed models and recover their watermark behavior.

By considering all rules from the most popular CM quality guideline, creating datasets for those rules, and training and evaluating state-of-the-art machine learning models to check those rules, we can answer the research question with: sufficiently well for practice, with the lowest F$_1$ score of 82.9\\%, for the most challenging task.

This paper introduces plug-and-play collaboration between specialized TMs, referred to as TM Composites. The collaboration relies on a TM's ability to specialize during learning and to assess its competence during inference. When teaming up, the most confident TMs make the decisions, relieving the uncertain ones. In this manner, a TM Composite becomes more competent than its members, benefiting from their specializations. The collaboration is plug-and-play in that members can be combined in any way, at any time, without fine-tuning. We implement three TM specializations in our empirical evaluation: Histogram of Gradients, Adaptive Gaussian Thresholding, and Color Thermometers. The resulting TM Composite increases accuracy on Fashion-MNIST by two percentage points, CIFAR-10 by twelve points, and CIFAR-100 by nine points, yielding new state-of-the-art results for TMs. Overall, we envision that TM Composites will enable an ultra-low energy and transparent alternative to state-of-the-art deep learning on more tasks and datasets.",

        "abstract": "The motivations of users to make interactions can be divided into static preference and dynamic interest. To accurately model user representations over time, recent studies in sequential recommendation utilize information propagation and evolution to mine from batches of arriving interactions. However, they ignore the fact that people are easily influenced by the recent actions of other users in the contextual scenario, and applying evolution across all historical interactions dilutes the importance of recent ones, thus failing to model the evolution of dynamic interest accurately. To address this issue, we propose a Context-Aware Pseudo-Multi-Task Recommender System (CPMR) to model the evolution in both historical and contextual scenarios by creating three representations for each user and item under different dynamics: static embedding, historical temporal states, and contextual temporal states. To dually improve the performance of temporal states evolution and incremental recommendation, we design a Pseudo-Multi-Task Learning (PMTL) paradigm by stacking the incremental single-target recommendations into one multi-target task for joint optimization. Within the PMTL paradigm, CPMR employs a shared-bottom network to conduct the evolution of temporal states across historical and contextual scenarios, as well as the fusion of them at the user-item level. In addition, CPMR incorporates one real tower for incremental predictions, and two pseudo towers dedicated to updating the respective temporal states based on new batches of interactions. Experimental results on four benchmark recommendation datasets show that CPMR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines and achieves significant gains on three of them.

        "abstract": "Fusing Radar and Lidar sensor data can fully utilize their complementary advantages and provide more accurate reconstruction of the surrounding for autonomous driving systems. Surround Radar/Lidar can provide 360-degree view sampling with the minimal cost, which are promising sensing hardware solutions for autonomous driving systems. However, due to the intrinsic physical constraints, the rotating speed of surround Radar, and thus the frequency to generate Radar data frames, is much lower than surround Lidar. Existing Radar/Lidar fusion methods have to work at the low frequency of surround Radar, which cannot meet the high responsiveness requirement of autonomous driving systems.This paper develops techniques to fuse surround Radar/Lidar with working frequency only limited by the faster surround Lidar instead of the slower surround Radar, based on the state-of-the-art object detection model MVDNet. The basic idea of our approach is simple: we let MVDNet work with temporally unaligned data from Radar/Lidar, so that fusion can take place at any time when a new Lidar data frame arrives, instead of waiting for the slow Radar data frame. However, directly applying MVDNet to temporally unaligned Radar/Lidar data greatly degrades its object detection accuracy. The key information revealed in this paper is that we can achieve high output frequency with little accuracy loss by enhancing the training procedure to explore the temporal redundancy in MVDNet so that it can tolerate the temporal unalignment of input data. We explore several different ways of training enhancement and compare them quantitatively with experiments.",

Notably, the RHPG algorithm does not require any prior knowledge of the system for initialization and does not require the target system to be open-loop stable. The key of RHPG is that we integrate vanilla PG (or any other policy search directions) into a dynamic programming outer loop, which iteratively decomposes the infinite-horizon KF problem that is constrained and non-convex in the policy parameter into a sequence of static estimation problems that are unconstrained and strongly-convex, thus enabling global convergence. We further provide fine-grained analyses of the optimization landscape under RHPG and detail the convergence and sample complexity guarantees of the algorithm. This work serves as an initial attempt to develop reinforcement learning algorithms specifically for control applications with performance guarantees by utilizing classic control theory in both algorithmic design and theoretical analyses. Lastly, we validate our theories by deploying the RHPG algorithm to learn the Kalman filter design of a large-scale convection-diffusion model.

Flow-based generative models are particularly attractive due to their ability to tractably provide exact density estimates along with fast, inexpensive and diverse samples. Training such models, however, requires a large, high quality dataset of objects. In applications such as computed imaging, it is often difficult to acquire such data due to requirements such as long acquisition time or high radiation dose, while acquiring noisy or partially observed measurements of these objects is more feasible. In this work, we propose AmbientFlow, a framework for learning flow-based generative models directly from noisy and incomplete data. Using variational Bayesian methods, a novel framework for establishing flow-based generative models from noisy, incomplete data is proposed. Extensive numerical studies demonstrate the effectiveness of AmbientFlow in correctly learning the object distribution.

Synthetic data generation is common in numerous domains. However, recently text augmentation has emerged in natural language processing (NLP) to improve downstream tasks. One of the current state-of-the-art text augmentation techniques is easy data augmentation (EDA), which augments the training data by injecting and replacing synonyms and randomly permuting sentences. One major obstacle with EDA is the need for versatile and complete synonym dictionaries, which cannot be easily found in low-resource languages. To improve the utility of EDA, we propose two extensions, easy distributional data augmentation (EDDA) and type specific similar word replacement (TSSR), which uses semantic word context information and part-of-speech tags for word replacement and augmentation. In an extensive empirical evaluation, we show the utility of the proposed methods, measured by F1 score, on two representative datasets in Swedish as an example of a low-resource language.

However, the previous and widely-used metrics for images are not applicable to evaluate the image semantic similarity in SC. Classical metrics to measure the similarity between two images usually rely on the pixel level or the structural level, such as the PSNR and the MS-SSIM. Straightforwardly using some tailored metrics based on deep-learning methods in CV community, such as the LPIPS, is infeasible for SC. To tackle this, inspired by BERTScore in NLP community, we propose a novel metric for evaluating image semantic similarity, named Vision Transformer Score (ViTScore). We prove theoretically that ViTScore has 3 important properties, including symmetry, boundedness, and normalization, which make ViTScore convenient and intuitive for image measurement. To evaluate the performance of ViTScore, we compare ViTScore with 3 typical metrics (PSNR, MS-SSIM, and LPIPS) through 5 classes of experiments. Experimental results demonstrate that ViTScore can better evaluate the image semantic similarity than the other 3 typical metrics, which indicates that ViTScore is an effective performance metric when deployed in SC scenarios.",

        "abstract": "Despite all recent progress, it is still challenging to edit and manipulate natural images with modern generative models. When using Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), one major hurdle is in the inversion process mapping a real image to its corresponding noise vector in the latent space, since its necessary to be able to reconstruct an image to edit its contents. Likewise for Denoising Diffusion Implicit Models (DDIM), the linearization assumption in each inversion step makes the whole deterministic inversion process unreliable. Existing approaches that have tackled the problem of inversion stability often incur in significant trade-offs in computational efficiency. In this work we propose an Accelerated Iterative Diffusion Inversion method, dubbed AIDI, that significantly improves reconstruction accuracy with minimal additional overhead in space and time complexity. By using a novel blended guidance technique, we show that effective results can be obtained on a large range of image editing tasks without large classifier-free guidance in inversion. Furthermore, when compared with other diffusion inversion based works, our proposed process is shown to be more robust for fast image editing in the 10 and 20 diffusion steps' regimes.",

Furthermore, taking benefit from their capacity to model latent long-range contextual relationships, we leverage Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) to facilitate multi-scale feature propagation between the BRM blocks.

While multi-task learning approaches have been proposed to address this problem, they pay little attention to task inference. In order to continually learn new tasks, the robot first needs to infer the task at hand without requiring predefined task representations. In this paper, we propose a self-supervised task inference approach. Our approach learns action and intention embeddings from self-organization of the observed movement and effect parts of unlabeled demonstrations and a higher-level behavior embedding from self-organization of the joint action-intention embeddings. We construct a behavior-matching self-supervised learning objective to train a novel Task Inference Network (TINet) to map an unlabeled demonstration to its nearest behavior embedding, which we use as the task representation. A multi-task policy is built on top of the TINet and trained with reinforcement learning to optimize performance over tasks. We evaluate our approach in the fixed-set and continual multi-task learning settings with a humanoid robot and compare it to different multi-task learning baselines. The results show that our approach outperforms the other baselines, with the difference being more pronounced in the challenging continual learning setting, and can infer tasks from incomplete demonstrations.

        "abstract": "Reducing unexpected urban traffic congestion caused by en-route events (e.g., road closures, car crashes, etc.) often requires fast and accurate reactions to choose the best-fit traffic signals. Traditional traffic light control systems, such as SCATS and SCOOT, are not efficient as their traffic data provided by induction loops has a low update frequency (i.e., longer than 1 minute). Moreover, the traffic light signal plans used by these systems are selected from a limited set of candidate plans pre-programmed prior to unexpected events' occurrence. Recent research demonstrates that camera-based traffic light systems controlled by deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms are more effective in reducing traffic congestion, in which the cameras can provide high-frequency high-resolution traffic data. However, these systems are costly to deploy in big cities due to the excessive potential upgrades required to road infrastructure. In this paper, we argue that Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) can play a crucial role in dealing with unexpected traffic congestion because UAVs with onboard cameras can be economically deployed when and where unexpected congestion occurs. Then, we propose a system called \"AVARS\" that explores the potential of using UAVs to reduce unexpected urban traffic congestion using DRL-based traffic light signal control. This approach is validated on a widely used open-source traffic simulator with practical UAV settings, including its traffic monitoring ranges and battery lifetime. Our simulation results show that AVARS can effectively recover the unexpected traffic congestion in Dublin, Ireland, back to its original un-congested level within the typical battery life duration of a UAV.",

        "abstract": "The literature on adversarial attacks in computer vision typically focuses on pixel-level perturbations. These tend to be very difficult to interpret. Recent work that manipulates the latent representations of image generators to create \"feature-level\" adversarial perturbations gives us an opportunity to explore perceptible, interpretable adversarial attacks. We make three contributions. First, we observe that feature-level attacks provide useful classes of inputs for studying representations in models. Second, we show that these adversaries are uniquely versatile and highly robust. We demonstrate that they can be used to produce targeted, universal, disguised, physically-realizable, and black-box attacks at the ImageNet scale. Third, we show how these adversarial images can be used as a practical interpretability tool for identifying bugs in networks. We use these adversaries to make predictions about spurious associations between features and classes which we then test by designing \"copy/paste\" attacks in which one natural image is pasted into another to cause a targeted misclassification. Our results suggest that feature-level attacks are a promising approach for rigorous interpretability research. They support the design of tools to better understand what a model has learned and diagnose brittle feature associations. Code is available at https://github.com/thestephencasper/feature_level_adv",

Despite several existing works that have contributed to the theoretical understanding of TD-learning, it is only in recent years that researchers have been able to establish concrete guarantees on its statistical efficiency. In this paper, we introduce a finite-time, control-theoretic framework for analyzing TD-learning, leveraging established concepts from the field of linear systems control. Consequently, this paper provides additional insights into the mechanics of TD learning and the broader landscape of reinforcement learning, all while employing straightforward analytical tools derived from control theory.",

Our proposed formulation can craft much stronger adversarial state perturbations of c-MARL agents to lower total team rewards than existing model-free approaches. In addition, we propose the first victim-agent selection strategy and the first data-driven approach to define targeted failure states where each of them allows us to develop even stronger adversarial attack without the expert knowledge to the underlying environment. Our numerical experiments on two representative MARL benchmarks illustrate the advantage of our approach over other baselines: our model-based attack consistently outperforms other baselines in all tested environments.",

        "abstract": "The traditional shortest-path graph kernel (SP) is one of the most popular graph kernels. It decomposes graphs into shortest paths and computes their frequencies in each graph. However, SP has two main challenges: Firstly, the triplet representation of the shortest path loses information. Secondly, SP compares graphs without considering the multiple different scales of the graph structure which is common in real-world graphs, e.g., the chain-, ring-, and star-structures in social networks. To overcome these two challenges, we develop a novel shortest-path graph kernel called the Multi-scale Wasserstein Shortest-Path Filtration graph kernel (MWSPF). It uses a BFS tree of a certain depth rooted at each vertex to restrict the maximum length of the shortest path considering the small world property. It considers the labels of all the vertices in the shortest path. To facilitate the comparison of graphs at multiple different scales, it augments graphs from both the aspects of the vertex and the graph structure. The distribution (frequency) of the shortest path changes across augmented graphs and the Wasserstein distance is employed to track the changes. We conduct experiments on various benchmark graph datasets to evaluate MWSPF's performance. MWSPF is superior to the state-of-the-art on most datasets.",

In this paper, we consider a probabilistic hierarchical modeling paradigm that combines the benefits of both worlds to deliver computationally efficient representations with inherent complexity regularization. The presented approaches are probabilistic interpretations of local regression techniques that approximate nonlinear functions through a set of local linear or polynomial units. Importantly, we rely on principles from Bayesian nonparametrics to formulate flexible models that adapt their complexity to the data and can potentially encompass an infinite number of components. We derive two efficient variational inference techniques to learn these representations and highlight the advantages of hierarchical infinite local regression models, such as dealing with non-smooth functions, mitigating catastrophic forgetting, and enabling parameter sharing and fast predictions. Finally, we validate this approach on large inverse dynamics datasets and test the learned models in real-world control scenarios.",

However, little research on SDM and quantitative evaluation of their effectiveness have been conducted on NLP tasks. Our paper fills the gap by proposing a benchmark named \"Discover, Explain, Improve (DEIM)\" for classification NLP tasks along with a new SDM Edisa. Edisa discovers coherent and underperforming groups of datapoints; DEIM then unites them under human-understandable concepts and provides comprehensive evaluation tasks and corresponding quantitative metrics. The evaluation in DEIM shows that Edisa can accurately select error-prone datapoints with informative semantic features that summarize error patterns. Detecting difficult datapoints directly boosts model performance without tuning any original model parameters, showing that discovered slices are actionable for users.",

EmoAug consists of a semantic encoder and a paralinguistic encoder that represent verbal and non-verbal information respectively. Additionally, a decoder reconstructs speech signals by conditioning on the aforementioned two information flows in an unsupervised fashion. Once training is completed, EmoAug enriches expressions of emotional speech with different prosodic attributes, such as stress, rhythm and intensity, by feeding different styles into the paralinguistic encoder. EmoAug enables us to generate similar numbers of samples for each class to tackle the data imbalance issue as well. Experimental results on the IEMOCAP dataset demonstrate that EmoAug can successfully transfer different speaking styles while retaining the speaker identity and semantic content. Furthermore, we train a SER model with data augmented by EmoAug and show that the augmented model not only surpasses the state-of-the-art supervised and self-supervised methods but also overcomes overfitting problems caused by data imbalance.

However, this design may lead to difficult access to multi-scale contextual information because of the unreasonable structure and hyperparameters. To lower the difficulty of drawing multi-scale contextual information, we propose a highly efficient multi-scale feature extraction method, which decomposes the original single-step method into two steps, Region Residualization-Semantic Residualization.In this method, the multi-rate depth-wise dilated convolutions take a simpler role in feature extraction: performing simple semantic-based morphological filtering with one desired receptive field in the second step based on each concise feature map of region form provided by the first step, to improve their efficiency. Moreover, the dilation rates and the capacity of dilated convolutions for each network stage are elaborated to fully utilize all the feature maps of region form that can be achieved.Accordingly, we design a novel Dilation-wise Residual (DWR) module and a Simple Inverted Residual (SIR) module for the high and low level network, respectively, and form a powerful DWR Segmentation (DWRSeg) network. Extensive experiments on the Cityscapes and CamVid datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method by achieving a state-of-the-art trade-off between accuracy and inference speed, in addition to being lighter weight.

To answer this question, we propose SMART: a Simple Multimodal Algorithmic Reasoning Task and the associated SMART-101 dataset, for evaluating the abstraction, deduction, and generalization abilities of neural networks in solving visuo-linguistic puzzles designed specifically for children in the 6--8 age group. Our dataset consists of 101 unique puzzles; each puzzle comprises a picture and a question, and their solution needs a mix of several elementary skills, including arithmetic, algebra, and spatial reasoning, among others. To scale our dataset towards training deep neural networks, we programmatically generate entirely new instances for each puzzle, while retaining their solution algorithm. To benchmark performances on SMART-101, we propose a vision and language meta-learning model using varied state-of-the-art backbones. Our experiments reveal that while powerful deep models offer reasonable performances on puzzles in a supervised setting, they are not better than random accuracy when analyzed for generalization. We also evaluate the recent ChatGPT and other large language models on a subset of SMART-101 and find that while these models show convincing reasoning abilities, the answers are often incorrect.",

        "abstract": "For Prognostics and Health Management (PHM) of Lithium-ion (Li-ion) batteries, many models have been established to characterize their degradation process. The existing empirical or physical models can reveal important information regarding the degradation dynamics. However, there are no general and flexible methods to fuse the information represented by those models. Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) is an efficient tool to fuse empirical or physical dynamic models with data-driven models. To take full advantage of various information sources, we propose a model fusion scheme based on PINN. It is implemented by developing a semi-empirical semi-physical Partial Differential Equation (PDE) to model the degradation dynamics of Li-ion batteries. When there is little prior knowledge about the dynamics, we leverage the data-driven Deep Hidden Physics Model (DeepHPM) to discover the underlying governing dynamic models. The uncovered dynamics information is then fused with that mined by the surrogate neural network in the PINN framework. Moreover, an uncertainty-based adaptive weighting method is employed to balance the multiple learning tasks when training the PINN. The proposed methods are verified on a public dataset of Li-ion Phosphate (LFP)/graphite batteries.",

        "abstract": "Variational inference is an approximation framework for Bayesian inference that seeks to improve quantified uncertainty in predictions by optimizing a simplified distribution over parameters to stand in for the full posterior. Capturing model variations that remain consistent with training data enables more robust predictions by reducing parameter sensitivity. This work introduces a fixed-point optimization for variational inference that is applicable when every feasible log density can be expressed as a linear combination of functions from a given basis. In such cases, the optimizer becomes a fixed-point of projective integral updates. When the basis spans univariate quadratics in each parameter, feasible densities are Gaussian and the projective integral updates yield quasi-Newton variational Bayes (QNVB). Other bases and updates are also possible. As these updates require high-dimensional integration, this work first proposes an efficient quasirandom quadrature sequence for mean-field distributions. Each iterate of the sequence contains two evaluation points that combine to correctly integrate all univariate quadratics and, if the mean-field factors are symmetric, all univariate cubics. More importantly, averaging results over short subsequences achieves periodic exactness on a much larger space of multivariate quadratics. The corresponding variational updates require 4 loss evaluations with standard (not second-order) backpropagation to eliminate error terms from over half of all multivariate quadratic basis functions. This integration technique is motivated by first proposing stochastic blocked mean-field quadratures, which may be useful in other contexts. A PyTorch implementation of QNVB allows for better control over model uncertainty during training than competing methods. Experiments demonstrate superior generalizability for multiple learning problems and architectures.",

By learning the latent representations of audio signals and their compositions without modeling the cross-modal relationship, AudioLDM is advantageous in both generation quality and computational efficiency. Trained on AudioCaps with a single GPU, AudioLDM achieves state-of-the-art TTA performance measured by both objective and subjective metrics (e.g., frechet distance).

To capture this complexity, high capacity architectures like recurrent- or attention-based sequential deep learning models have become popular. However, recent work demonstrates that simple univariate linear models can outperform such deep learning models on several commonly used academic benchmarks. Extending them, in this paper, we investigate the capabilities of linear models for time-series forecasting and present Time-Series Mixer (TSMixer), a novel architecture designed by stacking multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs). TSMixer is based on mixing operations along both the time and feature dimensions to extract information efficiently. On popular academic benchmarks, the simple-to-implement TSMixer is comparable to specialized state-of-the-art models that leverage the inductive biases of specific benchmarks. On the challenging and large scale M5 benchmark, a real-world retail dataset, TSMixer demonstrates superior performance compared to the state-of-the-art alternatives. Our results underline the importance of efficiently utilizing cross-variate and auxiliary information for improving the performance of time series forecasting. We present various analyses to shed light into the capabilities of TSMixer. The design paradigms utilized in TSMixer are expected to open new horizons for deep learning-based time series forecasting.

        "abstract": "Recent advances in text-to-image diffusion models have enabled the generation of diverse and high-quality images. While impressive, the images often fall short of depicting subtle details and are susceptible to errors due to ambiguity in the input text. One way of alleviating these issues is to train diffusion models on class-labeled datasets. This approach has two disadvantages: (i) supervised datasets are generally small compared to large-scale scraped text-image datasets on which text-to-image models are trained, affecting the quality and diversity of the generated images, or (ii) the input is a hard-coded label, as opposed to free-form text, limiting the control over the generated images.  In this work, we propose a non-invasive fine-tuning technique that capitalizes on the expressive potential of free-form text while achieving high accuracy through discriminative signals from a pretrained classifier. This is done by iteratively modifying the embedding of an added input token of a text-to-image diffusion model, by steering generated images toward a given target class according to a classifier. Our method is fast compared to prior fine-tuning methods and does not require a collection of in-class images or retraining of a noise-tolerant classifier. We evaluate our method extensively, showing that the generated images are: (i) more accurate and of higher quality than standard diffusion models, (ii) can be used to augment training data in a low-resource setting, and (iii) reveal information about the data used to train the guiding classifier.

        "abstract": "Language is essentially a complex, intricate system of human expressions governed by grammatical rules. It poses a significant challenge to develop capable AI algorithms for comprehending and grasping a language. As a major approach, language modeling has been widely studied for language understanding and generation in the past two decades, evolving from statistical language models to neural language models. Recently, pre-trained language models (PLMs) have been proposed by pre-training Transformer models over large-scale corpora, showing strong capabilities in solving various NLP tasks. Since researchers have found that model scaling can lead to performance improvement, they further study the scaling effect by increasing the model size to an even larger size. Interestingly, when the parameter scale exceeds a certain level, these enlarged language models not only achieve a significant performance improvement but also show some special abilities that are not present in small-scale language models. To discriminate the difference in parameter scale, the research community has coined the term large language models (LLM) for the PLMs of significant size. Recently, the research on LLMs has been largely advanced by both academia and industry, and a remarkable progress is the launch of ChatGPT, which has attracted widespread attention from society. The technical evolution of LLMs has been making an important impact on the entire AI community, which would revolutionize the way how we develop and use AI algorithms. In this survey, we review the recent advances of LLMs by introducing the background, key findings, and mainstream techniques. In particular, we focus on four major aspects of LLMs, namely pre-training, adaptation tuning, utilization, and capacity evaluation. Besides, we also summarize the available resources for developing LLMs and discuss the remaining issues for future directions.",

Furthermore, state discretization limits a robot's ability to follow human instructions based on the grounding of actions and states. To tackle these challenges, we present ARNOLD, a benchmark that evaluates language-grounded task learning with continuous states in realistic 3D scenes. ARNOLD is comprised of 8 language-conditioned tasks that involve understanding object states and learning policies for continuous goals. To promote language-instructed learning, we provide expert demonstrations with template-generated language descriptions. We assess task performance by utilizing the latest language-conditioned policy learning models. Our results indicate that current models for language-conditioned manipulations continue to experience significant challenges in novel goal-state generalizations, scene generalizations, and object generalizations.

We model the route recommendation strategy as a Markov Decision Process and propose a State Encoding mechanism that enables real-time planning and allocation in linear time.

        "abstract": "Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have received considerable attention not only for their superiority in energy efficiency with discrete signal processing but also for their natural suitability to integrate multi-scale biological plasticity. However, most SNNs directly adopt the structure of the well-established Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), and rarely automatically design Neural Architecture Search (NAS) for SNNs. The neural motifs topology, modular regional structure and global cross-brain region connection of the human brain are the product of natural evolution and can serve as a perfect reference for designing brain-inspired SNN architecture. In this paper, we propose a Multi-Scale Evolutionary Neural Architecture Search (MSE-NAS) for SNN, simultaneously considering micro-, meso- and macro-scale brain topologies as the evolutionary search space. MSE-NAS evolves individual neuron operation, self-organized integration of multiple circuit motifs, and global connectivity across motifs through a brain-inspired indirect evaluation function, Representational Dissimilarity Matrices (RDMs). This training-free fitness function could greatly reduce computational consumption and NAS's time, and its task-independent property enables the searched SNNs to exhibit excellent transferability on multiple datasets. Furthermore, MSE-NAS show robustness against the training method and noise. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with shorter simulation steps on static datasets (CIFAR10, CIFAR100) and neuromorphic datasets (CIFAR10-DVS and DVS128-Gesture). The thorough analysis also illustrates the significant performance improvement and consistent bio-interpretability deriving from the topological evolution at different scales and the RDMs fitness function.",

In this work, we examine whether SAM's performance extends to overhead imagery problems and help guide the community's response to its development. We examine SAM's performance on a set of diverse and widely studied benchmark tasks. We find that SAM does often generalize well to overhead imagery, although it fails in some cases due to the unique characteristics of overhead imagery and its common target objects.

In this work, we take a deep look at instance segmentation in the dark and introduce several techniques that substantially boost the low-light inference accuracy. The proposed method is motivated by the observation that noise in low-light images introduces high-frequency disturbances to the feature maps of neural networks, thereby significantly degrading performance. To suppress this ``feature noise\", we propose a novel learning method that relies on an adaptive weighted downsampling layer, a smooth-oriented convolutional block, and disturbance suppression learning. These components effectively reduce feature noise during downsampling and convolution operations, enabling the model to learn disturbance-invariant features. Furthermore, we discover that high-bit-depth RAW images can better preserve richer scene information in low-light conditions compared to typical camera sRGB outputs, thus supporting the use of RAW-input algorithms. Our analysis indicates that high bit-depth can be critical for low-light instance segmentation. To mitigate the scarcity of annotated RAW datasets, we leverage a low-light RAW synthetic pipeline to generate realistic low-light data. In addition, to facilitate further research in this direction, we capture a real-world low-light instance segmentation dataset comprising over two thousand paired low/normal-light images with instance-level pixel-wise annotations. Remarkably, without any image preprocessing, we achieve satisfactory performance on instance segmentation in very low light (4~\\% AP higher than state-of-the-art competitors), meanwhile opening new opportunities for future research.",

        "abstract": "Offline reinforcement learning (RL) is a learning paradigm where an agent learns from a fixed dataset of experience. However, learning solely from a static dataset can limit the performance due to the lack of exploration. To overcome it, offline-to-online RL combines offline pre-training with online fine-tuning, which enables the agent to further refine its policy by interacting with the environment in real-time. Despite its benefits, existing offline-to-online RL methods suffer from performance degradation and slow improvement during the online phase. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel framework called Ensemble-based Offline-to-Online (E2O) RL. By increasing the number of Q-networks, we seamlessly bridge offline pre-training and online fine-tuning without degrading performance. Moreover, to expedite online performance enhancement, we appropriately loosen the pessimism of Q-value estimation and incorporate ensemble-based exploration mechanisms into our framework. Experimental results demonstrate that E2O can substantially improve the training stability, learning efficiency, and final performance of existing offline RL methods during online fine-tuning on a range of locomotion and navigation tasks, significantly outperforming existing offline-to-online RL methods.",

        "abstract": "Rapid advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) have sparked growing concerns among experts, policymakers, and world leaders regarding the potential for increasingly advanced AI systems to pose catastrophic risks. Although numerous risks have been detailed separately, there is a pressing need for a systematic discussion and illustration of the potential dangers to better inform efforts to mitigate them. This paper provides an overview of the main sources of catastrophic AI risks, which we organize into four categories: malicious use, in which individuals or groups intentionally use AIs to cause harm; AI race, in which competitive environments compel actors to deploy unsafe AIs or cede control to AIs; organizational risks, highlighting how human factors and complex systems can increase the chances of catastrophic accidents; and rogue AIs, describing the inherent difficulty in controlling agents far more intelligent than humans. For each category of risk, we describe specific hazards, present illustrative stories, envision ideal scenarios, and propose practical suggestions for mitigating these dangers. Our goal is to foster a comprehensive understanding of these risks and inspire collective and proactive efforts to ensure that AIs are developed and deployed in a safe manner. Ultimately, we hope this will allow us to realize the benefits of this powerful technology while minimizing the potential for catastrophic outcomes.",

Yet, existing association-based approaches on rationalization cannot identify true rationales when two or more snippets are highly inter-correlated and thus provide a similar contribution to prediction accuracy, so-called spuriousness. To address this limitation, we novelly leverage two causal desiderata, non-spuriousness and efficiency, into rationalization from the causal inference perspective. We formally define a series of probabilities of causation based on a newly proposed structural causal model of rationalization, with its theoretical identification established as the main component of learning necessary and sufficient rationales. The superior performance of the proposed causal rationalization is demonstrated on real-world review and medical datasets with extensive experiments compared to state-of-the-art methods.",

Additionally, we are the first to show that humans can manually correct the reasoning of PIP-Net by directly disabling undesired prototypes.

In this article, we propose Select2Col, a novel collaborative perception framework that takes into account the {s}patial-t{e}mpora{l} importanc{e} of semanti{c} informa{t}ion. Within the Select2Col, we develop a collaborator selection method that utilizes a lightweight graph neural network (GNN) to estimate the importance of semantic information (IoSI) in enhancing perception performance, thereby identifying contributive collaborators while excluding those that bring negative impact. Moreover, we present a semantic information fusion algorithm called HPHA (historical prior hybrid attention), which integrates multi-scale attention and short-term attention modules to capture the IoSI in feature representation from the spatial and temporal dimensions respectively, and assigns IoSI-consistent weights for efficient fusion of information from selected collaborators. Extensive experiments on two open datasets demonstrate that our proposed Select2Col significantly improves the perception performance compared to state-of-the-art approaches.

In particular, we designed an ontology-driven fact-checking algorithm that compares biological graphs constructed from approximately 200,000 PubMed abstracts with counterparts constructed from a dataset generated using the ChatGPT-3.5 Turbo model. The nodes refer to biological entities (genes and diseases) that occur in the text. The edges represent the co-occurrence relationships of two entities mentioned in the same document, weighted by the proximity distance between these two entities. This research assumes a ``closed-world assumption'', meaning that fact-checking is performed only using the literature dataset as our ground truth. Results: in ten samples of 250 randomly selected records from the ChatGPT dataset of 1000 ``simulated'' articles , the fact-checking link accuracy ranged from 70% to 86%, while the remainder of the links remained unverified. Given the closed world assumption, the fact-checking precision is significant. When measuring and comparing the proximity distances of the edges of literature graphs against ChatGPT graphs we found that the ChatGPT distances were significantly shorter (ranging from 90 to 153) character distance. In contrast, the proximity distance of biological entities identified in the literature ranged from 236 to 765 character distance. This pattern held true for all the relationships among biological entities in the ten samples. Conclusion: this study demonstrated a reasonably high percentage accuracy of aggregate fact-checking of disease-gene relationships found in ChatGPT-generated texts. The strikingly consistent pattern of short proximity distances across all samples offers an illuminating feedback to the biological knowledge we possess in the literature today.",

        "abstract": "The integration of visual encoders and large language models (LLMs) has driven recent progress in multimodal large language models (MLLMs). However, the scarcity of high-quality instruction-tuning data for vision-language tasks remains a challenge. The current leading paradigm, such as LLaVA, relies on language-only GPT-4 to generate data, which requires pre-annotated image captions and detection bounding boxes, suffering from understanding image details. A practical solution to this problem would be to utilize the available multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to generate instruction data for vision-language tasks. However, it's worth noting that the currently accessible MLLMs are not as powerful as their LLM counterparts, as they tend to produce inadequate responses and generate false information. As a solution for addressing the current issue, this paper proposes the Visual Instruction Generation and Correction (VIGC) framework that enables multimodal large language models to generate instruction-tuning data and progressively enhance its quality on-the-fly. Specifically, Visual Instruction Generation (VIG) guides the vision-language model to generate diverse instruction-tuning data. To ensure generation quality, Visual Instruction Correction (VIC) adopts an iterative update mechanism to correct any inaccuracies in data produced by VIG, effectively reducing the risk of hallucination. Leveraging the diverse, high-quality data generated by VIGC, we finetune mainstream models and validate data quality based on various evaluations. Experimental results demonstrate that VIGC not only compensates for the shortcomings of language-only data generation methods, but also effectively enhances the benchmark performance.

For fine-tuning, the PEFT/LoRA based approach was used. In the study, the model was fine-tuned for the following tasks: analysing a text from financial market perspectives, highlighting main points of a text, summarizing a text and extracting named entities with appropriate sentiments. The obtained results show that the fine-tuned Llama 2 model can perform a multitask financial news analysis with a specified structure of response, part of response can be a structured text and another part of data can have JSON format for further processing. Extracted sentiments for named entities can be considered as predictive features in supervised machine learning models with quantitative target variables.",

        "abstract": "Despite the great advance of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in both instruction dataset building and benchmarking, the independence of training and evaluation makes current MLLMs hard to further improve their capability under the guidance of evaluation results with a relatively low human cost. In this paper, we propose MLLM-DataEngine, a novel closed-loop system that bridges data generation, model training, and evaluation. Within each loop iteration, the MLLM-DataEngine first analyze the weakness of the model based on the evaluation results, then generate a proper incremental dataset for the next training iteration and enhance the model capability iteratively. Compared with previous data collection methods which are separate from the benchmarking, the data generated by MLLM-DataEngine shows better targeting, quality, and correctness. For targeting, we propose an Adaptive Bad-case Sampling module, which adjusts the ratio of different types of data within each incremental dataset based on the benchmarking results. For quality, we resort to GPT-4 to generate high-quality data with each given data type. For correctness, prompt design is critical for the data generation results. Rather than previous hand-crafted prompt, we propose an Interactive Prompt Optimization strategy, which optimizes the prompt with the multi-round interaction between human and GPT, and improve the correctness of generated data greatly. Through extensive experiments, we find our MLLM-DataEngine could boost the MLLM capability in a targeted and automatic manner, with only a few human participation. We hope it could be a general solution for the following MLLMs building. The MLLM-DataEngine has been open-sourced and is now available at https://github.com/opendatalab/MLLM-DataEngine.",

Compared to SCNs and random vector functional-link (RVFL) nets with binarized implementation, the model storage of SCMs can be significantly compressed while retaining favourable prediction performance. Besides the architecture of the SCM learner model and its learning algorithm, as an important part of this contribution, we also provide a theoretical basis on the learning capacity of SCMs by analysing the model's complexity. Experimental studies are carried out over some benchmark datasets and three industrial applications. The results demonstrate that SCM has great potential for dealing with industrial data analytics.",

Existing methods often depend on pre-established emotional labels or facial expression templates, which may limit the necessary flexibility for accurately conveying user intent. In this research, we introduce a technique that enables the control of arbitrary styles by leveraging natural language as emotion prompts. This technique presents benefits in terms of both flexibility and user-friendliness. To realize this objective, we initially construct a Text-Expression Alignment Dataset (TEAD), wherein each facial expression is paired with several prompt-like descriptions.We propose an innovative automatic annotation method, supported by Large Language Models (LLMs), to expedite the dataset construction, thereby eliminating the substantial expense of manual annotation. Following this, we utilize TEAD to train a CLIP-based model, termed ExpCLIP, which encodes text and facial expressions into semantically aligned style embeddings. The embeddings are subsequently integrated into the facial animation generator to yield expressive and controllable facial animations. Given the limited diversity of facial emotions in existing speech-driven facial animation training data, we further introduce an effective Expression Prompt Augmentation (EPA) mechanism to enable the animation generator to support unprecedented richness in style control. Comprehensive experiments illustrate that our method accomplishes expressive facial animation generation and offers enhanced flexibility in effectively conveying the desired style.",

        "abstract": "Mobile task automation is an attractive technique that aims to enable voice-based hands-free user interaction with smartphones. However, existing approaches suffer from poor scalability due to the limited language understanding ability and the non-trivial manual efforts required from developers or end-users. The recent advance of large language models (LLMs) in language understanding and reasoning inspires us to rethink the problem from a model-centric perspective, where task preparation, comprehension, and execution are handled by a unified language model. In this work, we introduce AutoDroid, a mobile task automation system that can handle arbitrary tasks on any Android application without manual efforts. The key insight is to combine the commonsense knowledge of LLMs and domain-specific knowledge of apps through automated dynamic analysis. The main components include a functionality-aware UI representation method that bridges the UI with the LLM, exploration-based memory injection techniques that augment the app-specific domain knowledge of LLM, and a multi-granularity query optimization module that reduces the cost of model inference. We integrate AutoDroid with off-the-shelf LLMs including online GPT-4/GPT-3.5 and on-device Vicuna, and evaluate its performance on a new benchmark for memory-augmented Android task automation with 158 common tasks. The results demonstrated that AutoDroid is able to precisely generate actions with an accuracy of 90.9%, and complete tasks with a success rate of 71.3%, outperforming the GPT-4-powered baselines by 36.4% and 39.7%.

This approach represents the extension of a standards, licensing, and liability regime to the global level. We propose that states establish an International AI Organization (IAIO) to certify state jurisdictions (not firms or AI projects) for compliance with international oversight standards. States can give force to these international standards by adopting regulations prohibiting the import of goods whose supply chains embody AI from non-IAIO-certified jurisdictions. This borrows attributes from models of existing international organizations, such as the International Civilian Aviation Organization (ICAO), the International Maritime Organization (IMO), and the Financial Action Task Force (FATF). States can also adopt multilateral controls on the export of AI product inputs, such as specialized hardware, to non-certified jurisdictions. Indeed, both the import and export standards could be required for certification. As international actors reach consensus on risks of and minimum standards for advanced AI, a jurisdictional certification regime could mitigate a broad range of potential harms, including threats to public safety.",

        "abstract": "In prediction-based Neural Architecture Search (NAS), performance indicators derived from graph convolutional networks have shown significant success. These indicators, achieved by representing feed-forward structures as component graphs through one-hot encoding, face a limitation: their inability to evaluate architecture performance across varying search spaces. In contrast, handcrafted performance indicators (zero-shot NAS), which use the same architecture with random initialization, can generalize across multiple search spaces. Addressing this limitation, we propose a novel approach for zero-shot NAS using deep learning. Our method employs Fourier sum of sines encoding for convolutional kernels, enabling the construction of a computational feed-forward graph with a structure similar to the architecture under evaluation. These encodings are learnable and offer a comprehensive view of the architecture's topological information. An accompanying multi-layer perceptron (MLP) then ranks these architectures based on their encodings. Experimental results show that our approach surpasses previous methods using graph convolutional networks in terms of correlation on the NAS-Bench-201 dataset and exhibits a higher convergence rate. Moreover, our extracted feature representation trained on each NAS-Benchmark is transferable to other NAS-Benchmarks, showing promising generalizability across multiple search spaces.

        "abstract": "The objective of topic inference in research proposals aims to obtain the most suitable disciplinary division from the discipline system defined by a funding agency. The agency will subsequently find appropriate peer review experts from their database based on this division. Automated topic inference can reduce human errors caused by manual topic filling, bridge the knowledge gap between funding agencies and project applicants, and improve system efficiency. Existing methods focus on modeling this as a hierarchical multi-label classification problem, using generative models to iteratively infer the most appropriate topic information. However, these methods overlook the gap in scale between interdisciplinary research proposals and non-interdisciplinary ones, leading to an unjust phenomenon where the automated inference system categorizes interdisciplinary proposals as non-interdisciplinary, causing unfairness during the expert assignment. How can we address this data imbalance issue under a complex discipline system and hence resolve this unfairness? In this paper, we implement a topic label inference system based on a Transformer encoder-decoder architecture. Furthermore, we utilize interpolation techniques to create a series of pseudo-interdisciplinary proposals from non-interdisciplinary ones during training based on non-parametric indicators such as cross-topic probabilities and topic occurrence probabilities. This approach aims to reduce the bias of the system during model training. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on a real-world dataset to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.

This can lead to intellectual property theft and other security and privacy risks. The current state-of-the-art defenses against model stealing attacks suggest adding perturbations to the prediction probabilities. However, they suffer from heavy computations and make impracticable assumptions about the adversary. They often require the training of auxiliary models. This can be time-consuming and resource-intensive which hinders the deployment of these defenses in real-world applications. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective and efficient defense alternative. We introduce a heuristic approach to perturb the output probabilities. The proposed defense can be easily integrated into models without additional training. We show that our defense is effective in defending against three state-of-the-art stealing attacks. We evaluate our approach on large and quantized (i.e., compressed) Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) trained on several vision datasets. Our technique outperforms the state-of-the-art defenses with a $\\times37$ faster inference latency without requiring any additional model and with a low impact on the model's performance.

We present SayNav, a new approach that leverages human knowledge from Large Language Models (LLMs) for efficient generalization to complex navigation tasks in unknown large-scale environments. SayNav uses a novel grounding mechanism, that incrementally builds a 3D scene graph of the explored environment as inputs to LLMs, for generating feasible and contextually appropriate high-level plans for navigation. The LLM-generated plan is then executed by a pre-trained low-level planner, that treats each planned step as a short-distance point-goal navigation sub-task. SayNav dynamically generates step-by-step instructions during navigation and continuously refines future steps based on newly perceived information. We evaluate SayNav on a new multi-object navigation task, that requires the agent to utilize a massive amount of human knowledge to efficiently search multiple different objects in an unknown environment. SayNav outperforms an oracle based Point-nav baseline, achieving a success rate of 95.35% (vs 56.06% for the baseline), under the ideal settings on this task, highlighting its ability to generate dynamic plans for successfully locating objects in large-scale new environments.

How TT15 controls seed development and physiology is unknown. Here we show that tt15 mutants exhibit seed lethality with incomplete penetrance and maternal determinism that is correlated with endosperm cellularization defects, together with an increased sensitivity of seed germination to exogenous abscisic acid and paclobutrazol. We also reveal that flavanol deposition in the vacuole during tt15 seed development triggers premature endothelium cell death. An autoimmune-like syndrome characterized by callose and H2O2 accumulation was detected in endothelium at the seed abaxial pole. Similar phenotypes were observed with tt9/gfs9, a mutant defective in endomembrane trafficking and homotypic vacuole fusion. Double mutant analysis showed that tt9 partially rescued tt15 endothelium phenotypes. Consistent with seed mutant phenotypes, TT15 promoter activity was detected in endothelium and endosperm and TT15 protein was located mainly at the vacuolar membrane (tonoplast). Using fluorescence recovery after photobleaching, we demonstrated that tonoplast fluidity was increased in tt15 roots. Altogether our data suggest that TT15 regulates seed development and flavanol accumulation by modulating vacuole biogenesis and maintenance.",

        "abstract": "Plants are constantly exposed to changing environments, sometimes leading to extreme conditions and stress. For example, sudden exposure to high light leads to excess absorbed light energy, causing reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation. ROS damage the photosynthetic machinery, particularly the D1 protein in photosystem II (PSII), which therefore needs to be continuously repaired and replaced. The effect of the damage inflicted by high light is a prolonged decrease in photosynthetic efficiency. Hence, it is not surprising that photoinhibition has been subject to numerous experimental studies investigating its effects in the context of crop productivity. However, it has become apparent that classical measures of photoinhibition, i.e., changes in the chlorophyll fluorescence parameter Fv/Fm, are not only determined by the loss of PSII core function but also by processes such as energy transfer and quenching. Mathematical models can help dissect the influences on such fluorescence signals and quantify the contributions of various interacting mechanisms. We present a mathematical model with a dynamic description of the photosynthetic electron transport chain (PETC), non-photochemical quenching, and photoinhibition. With our model, we investigate the interconnection between quenching, photoprotection, and fluorescence using simulations and experimental data. We found that different energy-dissipating properties of intact and damaged PSIIs, as well as energy transfer between PSIIs, are critical components that need to be included in the model to ensure a satisfactory fit to the experimental data. We envisage that our model provides a framework for future investigations of photoinhibition dynamics and its importance for plant growth and yield.",

        "abstract": "Macroautophagy is frequently quantified by live imaging of autophagosomes decorated with a marker of fluorescently tagged ATG8 protein (FT-ATG8) in Arabidopsis thaliana. This requires generation of suitable plant material by time-consuming crossing or transformation with FT-ATG8 marker. Autophagosome quantification by image analysis often relies on their counting in individual focal planes. This approach is prone to deliver biased results due to inappropriate sampling of the regions of interest in the Z-direction, as the actual 3D distribution of autophagosomes is usually not taken into account. To overcome such drawbacks, we have developed and tested a workflow consisting of immunofluorescence microscopy of autophagosomes labelled with anti-ATG8 antibody followed by stereological image analysis employing the optical disector and the Cavalieri principle. Our immunolabelling protocol specifically recognized autophagosomes in epidermal cells of A. thaliana root. Higher numbers of immunolabelled autophagosomes were observed when compared with those recognized with FT-AtATG8e marker, suggesting that single AtATG8 isoform markers cannot detect all autophagosomes in a cell. Therefore, immunolabelling provides more precise information as the anti-ATG8 antibody recognizes virtually all AtATG8 isoforms. The number of autophagosomes per tissue volume determined by stereological methods correlated with the intensity of autophagy induction treatment. Compared to autophagosome quantifications in maximum intensity projections, stereological methods detected autophagosomes present in a given volume with higher accuracy. Our novel application of immunolabelling combined with stereological methods constitutes a powerful toolbox for unbiased and reproducible quantification of autophagosomes and offers a convenient alternative to the standard of live imaging using FP-ATG8 marker.",

        "abstract": "Carotenoids support plant developmental activities as photosynthesis and photoprotective pigments, and also provide precursors for production of phytohormone abscisic acid and strigolactones, or bioactive apocarotenoids. Herein, we examined the role of carotenoid as a source of apocarotenoids, which control endogenous auxin levels and plant root architecture. Inhibiting {beta}-carotene biosynthesis by phytoene desaturase (PDS) inhibitor fluridone suppresses root growth, consequently inducing lateral root growth. PDS was confirmed to be the target of fluridone via the expression of the fluridone-insensitive trait 35S::mHvPDS in an Arabidopsis plant. Inhibiting {beta}-carotene biosynthesis elevated endogenous auxin levels and activated auxin signaling, thereby suppressing root growth. In addition, the root growth of the auxin-deficient mutant yucQ was partially restored via fluridone treatment. These results indicate that suppressing PDS activity increases endogenous auxin levels and suppresses root growth. Conversely, the carotenoid pool indirectly suppresses endogenous auxin levels. Exogenous application of retinal, apocarotenoid derived from {beta}-carotene, complemented fluridone-mediated root growth inhibition and partially recovered auxin-mediated growth inhibition. Moreover, retinal inhibited the induction of the auxin-inducible reporter pIAA19::ElucPEST, indicating an antagonistic effect of retinal on endogenous auxin levels. Interestingly, the auxin-deficient mutants wei2 wei7 and yucQ accumulated more {beta}-carotene compared with the wild type. The expression of CCDs, which converts {beta}-carotene into apocarotenoids, is auxin-inducible and increases following fluridone treatment. These results indicate feedback regulation during apocarotenoid biosynthesis in plant tissue. Thus, we conclude carotenoid regulates auxin levels and response, and this regulation is intermediated by apocarotenoid retinal.",

Moreover, individual plants within a population will undergo the developmental transitions asynchronously, so it is difficult to assemble a time series to resolve the sequence of transcriptional changes that take place during these rapid transitions. Single-plant-omics has the potential to distinguish between transcriptional events that are associated with these binary and continuous processes. Furthermore, we can utilise single-plant-omics to exploit this developmental asynchrony to order individual plants by their developmental trajectory, revealing a detailed cascade of transcriptional events. Here, we utilise single-plant-transcriptomics to resolve the transcriptional events that coincide with the onset of bolting. We performed RNA-seq on the leaves of individual plants from a large population of wild type Arabidopsis thaliana replicated at one time point during the vegetative-to-reproductive transition. Even though more than half of transcripts were differentially expressed between bolted and unbolted plants, we were able to find a subset of regulators that were more closely associated with gradual developmental traits like leaf size and biomass. Using a novel pseudotime inference algorithm, we determined that some senescence-associated processes, such as the reduction in ribosome biogenesis, are evident in the transcriptome before a bolt is visible. These results show the potential of single-plant-omics to reveal the detailed sequence of events that occur during rapid developmental transitions.",

        "abstract": "In land plants, gametes derive from a small number of dedicated haploid cells. In angiosperms, one central cell and one egg cell are differentiated in the embryo sac as female gametes for double fertilization, while in non-flowering plants, only one egg cell is generated in the female sexual organ, called the archegonium. The central cell specification of Arabidopsis thaliana is controlled by the histidine kinase CYTOKININ-INDEPENDENT 1 (CKI1), which is a two-component signaling (TCS) activator sharing downstream regulatory components with the cytokinin signaling pathway. Our phylogenetic analysis suggested that CKI1 orthologs broadly exist in land plants. However, the role of CKI1 in the archegonium-bearing non-flowering plants remains unclear. Here we found that the sole CKI1 ortholog in the liverwort Marchantia polymorpha, MpCKI1, which functions through conserved downstream TCS components, regulates the female germline specification for egg cell development in the archegonium. In M. polymorpha, the archegonium develops three-dimensionally from a single cell, accumulating MpBONOBO (MpBNB), a master regulator for germline initiation and differentiation. We visualized female germline specification by capturing the distribution pattern of MpBNB in the discrete stages of early archegonium development, and found that the MpBNB accumulation is restricted to female germline cells. MpCKI1 is required for the proper MpBNB accumulation in the female germline, and is critical for the asymmetric cell divisions that specify the female germline cells. These results suggest that CKI1-mediated TCS originated during early land plant evolution and participates in female germ cell specification in deeply-diverged plant lineages.",

        "abstract": "CONTEXT: Drought and extreme heat at flowering are common stresses limiting the yield of summer crops, which are likely to intensify and become more frequent as projected under climate change. OBJECTIVE: This study explores the idea that adaptation to these stresses could be increased by sowing summer crops early in late winter or spring, to avoid the overlap with critical crop stages around flowering. Here we report on the impacts of early sowing i.e., in late winter and spring on sorghum crop and root growth and function (i.e., water use), and final grain yield. METHODS: Two seasons of on-farm genotype (G) by environment (E) by management (M) sorghum experimentation were conducted in the Darling Downs region of Queensland, Australia. Each trial consisted of a factorial combination of three times of sowing (TOS, referred to as late winter, spring, and summer), two levels of irrigation, four target plant populations, and six commercial genotypes. Treatments were replicated three times. Crop roots and shoot were sampled at the flag leaf stage for each TOS. Crop water use across the growing season was monitored using time-lapse electromagnetic induction (EMI) surveys. EMI was also used to calculate a root activity factor. Final grain yield and yield components were determined at maturity. RESULTS: Results showed that TOS, irrigation levels, and their interactions significantly influenced crop root and shoot traits, water use, and yield, though results were not always consistent across seasons. In the first season which was dry and had large temperature contrasts between TOS, crop growth in the early sown crops was primarily limited by temperature. In contrast, the second season was much warmer and crop growth was instead primarily limited by water availability. Cold air and soil temperatures in the early sowing dates during the first season i.e., late winter and spring, lead to smaller crops with smaller rooting systems and root-to-shoot ratios, and roots having a larger average root diameter. In general terms, root length growth and root length density responded positively to increasing pre-flowering mean air temperatures ranging between 16 and 20C, while root average diameters were larger below 19 or above 21C. Early sowing advanced flowering and therefore decreased the risk of extreme heat during the critical stages around flowering and affected water use before and after flowering. The root activity factor was directly related to the crop root length density. The early sown crops increased yield by transferring water use from vegetative to reproductive stages. The larger yield of early sown sorghum was associated with larger grain numbers. Early sown crops had larger values of water use efficiency associated with larger total grain numbers, particularly for the tillers. As expected, the lowest values of water use efficiency were observed in irrigated and summer sown crops. The early sowing times left more water in the soil profile at maturity, particularly under irrigated conditions and with small plant populations. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that early sown sorghum is a potential option to increase crop adaptation to hotter and drier environments. Here we propose that in the race to increase crop adaptation to heat stresses, plant breeding efforts should consider cold tolerance traits during crop germination, emergence, and early vegetative stages so that sorghum sowing windows could be significantly advanced.",

We identified 14,766 differentially expressed genes, of which 4369 genes showed alternative splicing. We observed that genes mapped to the plastid-localized methyl-erythritol-phosphate (MEP) pathway were upregulated in light compared to the cytosolic mevalonate (MVA) pathway genes. Many of these genes also undergo splicing. These pathways provide crucial metabolite precursors for the biosynthesis of secondary metabolic compounds needed for chloroplast biogenesis, the establishment of successful photosynthetic apparatus, and photomorphogenesis. In the chromosome-wide survey of the light-induced transcriptome, we observed intron retention as the most predominant splicing event. In addition, we identified 1709 novel lncRNA transcripts in our transcriptome data.",

Genetic variations in the resistance against salt stress found in rapeseed genotypes emphasizes the complex response architecture. Westar is ubiquitously used as a major transgenic receptor, and ZS11 is widely grown as a high production and good quality cultivar. In this study, Westar was identified to outperform than ZS11 under salt stress. Through cell component isolation, non-invasive micro-test, X-ray energy spectrum analysis, and ionomic profiling characterization, pectin demethylation was found to be a major regulator for differential salt resistance between Westar and ZS11. Integrated analyses of genome-wide DNA variations, differentially expression profiling, and gene co-expression network identified BnaC9.PME47, encoding pectin methyl esterase, as a positive regulator mainly responsible for salt stress resistance. BnaC9.PME47, located in two reported QTLs regions for salt resistance, was strongly induced by salt stress and localized on the cell wall. Natural variation of the promoter regions conferred higher expression of BnaC9.PME47 in Westar than in other salt-sensitive rapeseed genotypes. Loss-of-function of AtPME47 resulted in the hypersensitivity of Arabidopsis plants to salt stress. This study facilitates a more comprehensive understanding of the differential morpho-physiological and molecular responses to salt stress and abundant genetic diversity in rapeseed genotypes, and the integrated multiomics analyses provide novel insights regarding the rapid dissection of quantitative trait genes responsible for nutrient stresses in plant species with complex genomes.",

We determined that the prokaryotic diversity has higher in the bladders with respect to the leaves. Fungal communities, in turn, were more diverse in leaves than in bladders.

Breeding for potato resistance to P. infestans has focused on the use of NLRs, however, these genes are typically quickly overcome since the matching avirulence genes evolve exceptionally quickly.

We found that PERU and RLP23 cooperate for the early immune responses like the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and production of ethylene by recognizing their corresponding PAMPs. Furthermore, we show that potato plants overexpressing these two PRRs are slightly less affected by P. infestans compared to the single transformants. Together, our data suggest that pyramiding of surface receptors can provide additional enhanced resistance against pathogens, however, more effective or synergistic combinations that may include intracellular NLR receptors should be explored.",

We collated genome size and extinction risk information for a representative sample of angiosperms comprising 3,250 species, which we analyzed alongside life form, endemism and climate variables using a phylogenetic framework. Angiosperm genome size is positively correlated with extinction risk, a pattern driven by a signal in herbaceous but not woody species, regardless of climate and endemism. The influence of genome size is stronger in endemic herbaceous species, but is relatively homogenous across different climates. Beyond its indirect link via endemism and climate, genome size also influences extinction risk directly and significantly. Genome size may serve as a proxy for difficult-to-measure parameters associated with resilience and vulnerability in herbaceous angiosperms.

In legumes, endosymbiosis with nitrogen fixing bacteria (rhizobia) is a key adaptation for supplying the plant with nitrogen in the form of ammonium. Rhizobia are housed in lateral root-derived organs termed nodules that maintain an environment conducive to Nitrogenase in these bacteria. Several phytohormones are important for regulating the formation of nodules, with both positive and negative roles proposed for gibberellin (GA). In this study, we determined the cellular location and function of bioactive GA during nodule organogenesis using a genetically-encoded second generation GA biosensor, GPS2. We found endogenous bioactive GA accumulates locally at the site of nodule primordia, increasing dramatically in the cortical cell layers, persisting through cell divisions and maintaining accumulation in the mature nodule meristem. We show, through mis-expression of GA catabolic enzymes that suppress GA accumulation, that GA acts as a positive regulator of nodule growth and development. Furthermore, increasing or decreasing GA through perturbation of biosynthesis gene expression can increase or decrease the size of nodules, respectively. This is unique from lateral root formation, a developmental program that shares common organogenesis regulators. We link GA to a wider gene regulatory program by showing that cytokinin as well as nodule-identity genes induce and sustain GA accumulation necessary for nodule function.",

No functional orthologues of NbPTR1 were found in A. chinensis. NbPTR1 transformed into Psa3-susceptible A. chinensis var. chinensis Hort16A plants introduced HopZ5-specific resistance against Psa3. Altogether, this study suggested that expressing NbPTR1 in Psa3-susceptible kiwifruit is a viable approach to acquiring resistance to Psa3 and it provides valuable information for engineering resistance in otherwise susceptible kiwifruit genotypes.",

        "abstract": "Yerba mate (Ilex paraguariensis) is an economically important crop marketed for the elaboration of mate, the third-most widely consumed caffeine-containing infusion worldwide. Here we report the first genome assembly of this species, which has a total length of 1.06 Gb and contains 53,390 protein-coding genes. Comparative analyses revealed that the large yerba mate genome size is partly due to a whole-genome duplication (Ip-) during the early evolutionary history of Ilex, in addition to the hexaploidization event ({gamma}) shared by core eudicots. Characterization of the genome allowed us to clone the genes encoding methyltransferase enzymes that catalyse multiple reactions required for caffeine production. To our surprise, this species has converged upon a different biochemical pathway compared to that of its relatives, coffee and tea. In order to gain insight into the structural basis for the convergent enzyme activities, we obtained a crystal structure for the terminal enzyme in the pathway that forms caffeine. The structure reveals that convergent solutions have evolved for substrate positioning because different amino acid residues facilitate a different substrate orientation such that efficient methylation occurs in the independently evolved enzymes in yerba mate and coffee. While our results show phylogenomic constraint limits the genes coopted for convergence of caffeine biosynthesis, the x-ray diffraction data suggests structural constraints are minimal for the convergent evolution of individual reactions.",

        "abstract": "Riboflavin (RF) serves as a precursor to FMN and FAD, crucial cofactors in various metabolic processes. Strict regulation of cellular flavin homeostasis is imperative, yet information regarding the factors governing this regulation remains largely elusive. In this study, we first examined the impact of external flavin treatment on the Arabidopsis transcriptome to identify novel regulators of cellular flavin levels. Our analysis revealed alterations in the expression of 49 putative transcription factors. Subsequent reverse genetic screening highlighted a member of the Dehydration-Responsive Element Binding (DREB) family, AtDREB2G, as a potential regulator of cellular flavin levels. Knockout mutants of AtDREB2G (dreb2g) exhibited reduced flavin levels and decreased expression of RF biosynthetic genes compared to wild-type plants. Conversely, conditional overexpression of AtDREB2G led to an increase in the expression of RF biosynthetic genes and elevated flavin levels. In wild-type plants, exposure to low temperatures and abscisic acid treatment stimulated enhanced flavin levels and upregulated the expression of RF biosynthetic genes, concomitant with the induction of AtDREB2G. Notably, these responses were significantly attenuated in dreb2g mutants. Our findings establish AtDREB2G as a novel positive regulator of flavin biosynthesis in Arabidopsis, particularly under conditions of low temperature and abscisic acid treatment.",

        "abstract": "The devastating soybean rust (SBR) pathogen, Phakopsora pachyrhizi, encodes many secreted proteins, but only two have been functionally characterized for their roles in rust virulence. Here, we demonstrate that transient expression of P. pachyrhizi effector candidate 15 (PpEC15), an aspartic protease, leads to enhanced bacterial growth in planta, suppression of callose deposition, reduced expression of plant defense-related marker genes and suppression of pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP)-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS). Stable expression of PpEC15 in soybean suppresses PAMP-induced ROS production and enhances bacterial growth, indicating that, collectively, PpEC15 suppresses host and non-host innate immune responses. Yeast-two-hybrid and proximity labeling identified putative PpEC15 interacting partners including a peptide-chain release factor (PCRF), a NAC83 (NAM, ATAF, and CUC) transcription factor, and a DAHP (3-deoxy-7-phosphoheptulonate) synthase. We further show that PpEC15 is able to cleave DAHP, but does not cleave PCRF or NAC83. Virus-induced gene silencing of NAC83, PCRF and DAHP altered PAMP-induced ROS production and salicylic acid production, indicating that these proteins may be involved in immune signaling. Collectively, our data show that PpEC15 is conserved across P. pachyrhizi isolates and other economically important rust species and is involved in the suppression of plant basal defense responses. Understanding the role of PpEC15 in P. pachyrhizi virulence will provide a foundation for designing targeted intervention strategies to generate rust-resistant crops.",

At the same time, various working groups have studied this pathosystem using different approaches, contributing to the scientific knowledge of the disease. By recognizing the importance of a thorough bibliographic review and meticulous organization of information, the process of initiating new research projects becomes more effective. In light of this, the aim of this work was to provide a comprehensive scientometric analysis of the evolution of peanut smut research, spanning from its inception to the current day. For this purpose, we compiled bibliographic data about the disease and extracted information to calculate metrics. We observed that a smaller proportion of the scientific production was presented in peer-reviewed journals, the prevalent topics were epidemiology and breeding, and the collaborative endeavors were crucial for the scientific advancement in the study of this pathosystem. Additionally, the researchers with the most significant presence in the publications, the involved institutions, and the impact of the produced papers, among other trends were identified. Although there have been many scientific-technological advances in peanut smut over the years, this information is not reflected in scientific papers in peer-reviewed journals, which represents a great challenge for researchers involved in this topic. It is crucial to continue generating knowledge that contributes to the integrated management of this complex pathosystem. This will prevent further yield losses and the spread of the pathogen to new production areas.",

For example, they jointly exhibit enhanced levels of basal defense and stunted growth. Here we show that these two phenotypes are functionally connected by their dependency on the salicylic acid biosynthesis gene SID2 and the basal defense regulatory gene PAD4. Stunted growth of edm2, edm3 and ibm2 plants is a consequence of up-regulated basal defense. Constitutively enhanced activity of reactive oxygen species-generating peroxidases, we observed in these mutants, appears also to contribute to both, their enhanced basal defense and their growth retardation phenotypes. Furthermore, we found the histone H3 demethylase gene IBM1, a direct regulatory target of EDM2, EDM3 and IBM2, to be at least partially required for the basal defense and growth-related effects observed in these mutants. We recently reported that EDM2, EDM3 and IBM2 coordinate the extent of basal immunity with the timing of the floral transition. Together with these observations, data presented here show that at least some of the diverse phenotypic effects in edm2, edm3 and ibm2 mutants are genetically interlinked and functionally connected.",

In the case of inter-subgeneric hybridization in water lily, there exists a pre-fertilization hybridization barrier, the regulatory mechanism of which remains unclear. In this study, we conducted hormone and transcriptome analyses of unpollinated stigmas (Mock), self-pollinated stigmas (SP), cross-pollinated stigmas within the same subgenus (CP), and inter-subgenus cross-pollination stigmas (ISCP) in water lily to elucidate the formation mechanism of the inter-subgeneric hybridization barrier. Our results indicated that the lack of ABA and BR in ISCP stigmas are key factors contributing to the formation of the inter-subgeneric hybridization barrier in water lily. Exogenous application of ABA and BR can help overcome the barrier between inter-subgeneric water lily crosses. Through transcriptome analysis, we identified nine candidate genes involved in regulating the inter-subgeneric hybridization barrier in water lily. In addition, we further demonstrated the importance of the NCED2-mediated ABA synthesis pathway in the hybridization process through AS-ODN technology. Our study confirms that ABA and BR are critical for breaking the inter-subgeneric hybridization barrier in water lily. The identification of the nine candidate genes provides important clues for further research on the hybridization recognition mechanism in water lily.",

Identifying how to describe new species more efficiently is key to completing the inventory of the Neotropical flora in an era of massive biodiversity loss. C_LIO_LIHere we calculate the interval between first specimen collection and new species publication for a group of 2126 Neotropical trees, and discuss the historical context surrounding specimen collection and new species publication events. C_LIO_LIOur results reveal that on average, it takes almost 16 years from specimen collection to publication of a new Neotropical tree species, which is considerably shorter than previous estimates for other tropical groups. The central Andes is the region that had the longest average time lags, while the Choco had the shortest. Peru had the longest average time lags by country, while Haiti had the shortest. The average time lags increased until the early 1900s, when a decrease was observed, with the shortest lags between 1941 to 1960. C_LIO_LIWe found that the majority of the species described more rapidly are from plants collected and described by the same researcher. We demonstrate how political instability and conflict can delay or impede the completion of research initiatives in the region. We argue that enhancing international collaboration and training opportunities in Latin American countries, as well as ensuring safe plant collection campaigns, are critical to complete the inventory of the Neotropical flora.

We show that this balance is modulated epigenetically by DNA methylation and orchestrated by IBM2, a factor involved in the processing of intronic heterochromatin. The stress-sensitive allele of FLC has recently spread across populations subjected to recurrent chemical weeding, and we demonstrate that retrotransposon-driven acceleration of life cycle represents a rapid response to herbicide.

The incidence of fungi infecting AYB were surveyed in Oyo, Ondo, Ekiti, Osun, and Ogun states within SW Nigeria during 2018 planting season. The common field symptoms across all sites were tiny spot, brown spot, leaf blight, brown spot with yellow halo, necrotic lesion, and brown spot on pods. A total of 1005 fungi were isolated from leaf and pod samples, and identified morphologically on pure cultures as Aspergillus sp, Botrytis sp, Colletotrichum gloeosporioides, Curvularia lunata, Trichoderma harzianum, Macrophomina phaseolina, Pestalotia sp, Phoma sp, Fusarium verticillioides, F. oxysporum, F. solani, Botryodiplodia theobromae, and Choanephora curcubitarium and Nigrospora spp. Phoma sp and C. gleosporoides had highest frequency of occurrence 69.9% and 51.9% at early and mature stages, respectively. To conform to Kochs postulates, the pathogenicities of 12 exemplar strains of the most abundant fungal species were confirmed in controlled glasshouse tests. The identities of Colletotrichum sp., Aspergillus sp., Didymella sp., Pestalopsis sp, Lasiodiplodia theobromae, F. solani and F. oxysporum were confirmed based on internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequencing and comparisons with the Genbank database.

The precise mechanisms underlying transmission of functions of these associations are often difficult to describe, due to the difficulty in separating the symbiotic partners.

Here, we demonstrate the potential of the leaf symbiosis between the wild yam Dioscorea sansibarensis and the bacterium Orrella dioscoreae (O. dioscoreae) as a model system for hereditary symbiosis. O. dioscoreae is easy to grow and genetically manipulate, which is unusual for hereditary symbionts. These properties allowed us to design an effective antimicrobial treatment to rid plants of bacteria and generate whole aposymbiotic plants, which can later be re-inoculated with bacterial cultures. Aposymbiotic plants did not differ morphologically from symbiotic plants and the leaf forerunner tip containing the symbiotic glands formed normally even in the absence of bacteria, but microscopic differences between symbiotic and aposymbiotic glands highlight the influence of bacteria on the development of trichomes and secretion of mucilage. This is to our knowledge the first leaf symbiosis where both host and symbiont can be grown separately and where the symbiont can be genetically altered and reintroduced to the host.",

The pgr5 mutant is characterized by impaired proton motive force (pmf) formation across the thylakoid membrane, decreased photoprotective non-photochemical quenching (NPQ), and an over-reduction of the PSI acceptor side. This over-reduction has been attributed to impaired photosynthetic control, which down-regulates plastoquinol re-oxidation at the cytochrome b6f complex when the lumen is strongly acidified. Here, using the cgl160 ATP synthase assembly mutant, we show that in cgl160 pgr5 double mutants, both the pmf across the thylakoid membrane and NPQ are fully restored to wild-type levels. However, the acceptor-side limitation of PSI in the double mutants stays comparable to the single pgr5 mutant. This demonstrates that impaired photosynthetic control is not causal for the over-reduction of the PSI acceptor side in pgr5. Instead, we show that both in pgr5 and the clg160 pgr5 mutants, the entire high-potential chain from cytochrome f to PSI remains strongly reduced in high light. This leads to insufficient oxidizing power for plastoquinol re-oxidation by the cytochrome b6f complex, thus impairing pmf formation. We conclude that PGR5 plays a critical role in electron partitioning downstream of PSI.",

Taking advantage of mutants showing temperature-dependent phenotypes we conducted a comprehensive study of the role that the methylosome and SMN complexes have in plant snRNP assembly. Genetic analyses, as well as in vivo and in vitro evidence suggest a mechanism for snRNP assembly in plants that differs remarkably from vertebrate animals. The SMN complex in plants is apparently reduced to a single protein, GEMIN2, that is not essential for plant development. Similarly, the methylosome has a less crucial role in spliceosome assembly than previously thought.

Additionally, it serves as a production platform to test vaccines and other valuable substances. Among its approximately 3.1 Gb genome, 57,583 genes have been annotated within a 61 Mb region. We created a comprehensive and easy-to-use platform to use transcriptomes for modern annotation. These tools allow to visualize gene expression profiles, draw molecular evolutionary phylogenetic trees of gene families, perform functional enrichment analyses, and facilitate output downloads. To demonstrate their utility, we analyzed the gene expression profiles of enzymes within the nicotine biosynthesis pathway, a secondary metabolic pathway characteristic of the Nicotiana genus. Using the developed tool, expression profiles of the nicotine biosynthesis pathway genes were generated. The expression patterns of eight gene groups in the pathway were strongly expressed in the roots and weakly expressed in leaves and flowers of N. benthamiana. The results were consistent with the established gene expression profiles in Nicotiana tabacum and provided insights into gene family composition and expression trends. The compilation of this database tool can facilitate genetic analysis of N. benthamiana in the future.  Significance statementA tool was developed to visualize gene expression profiles, draw molecular evolutionary phylogenetic trees of gene families, perform functional enrichment analyses, and facilitate output downloads of Nicotiana benthamiana. The database developed using the tool can evolve into a comprehensive all-in-one analysis platform by continuously incorporating transcriptome data released to date, newly released RNA-seq data, and annotations in the future.",

        "abstract": "C4 photosynthesis has arisen from the ancestral C3 state in over sixty lineages of angio-sperms. It is widely accepted that an early step in C4 evolution is restriction of glycine decarboxylase activity to bundle sheath cells to generate the so-called C2 pathway. In C2 Moricandia species, changes to the cis-regulatory region controlling expression of the P-subunit of GLYCINE DECARBOXYLASE (GLDP) in mesophyll cells enables this trait, but the mechanism underpinning GLDP expression in the bundle sheath is not known. We identify a MYC-MYB transcription factor module previously associated with the control of glucosinolate bio-synthesis as the basis of GLDP expression in bundle sheath cells. In C3 Arabidopsis thaliana this module drives GLDP expression in bundle sheath cells along with as yet unidentified factors driving expression in mesophyll cells. In the C2 species Moricandia arvensis, GLDP expression is lost from mesophyll cells and the MYC-MYB dependent expression in the bundle sheath is revealed. Evolution of C2 photosynthesis is thus associated with a MYC-MYB based transcriptional network already present in the C3 state. This work identifies a molecular genetic mechanism underlying the bundle sheath accumulation of glycine decarboxylase required for C2 photosynthesis and thus a foundational step in the evolution of C4 photosynthesis.",

        "abstract": "Global environmental change is pushing many socio-environmental systems towards critical thresholds, where ecological systems' states are on the precipice of tipping points and interventions are needed to navigate or avert impending transitions. Flickering, where a system vacillates between alternative stable states, is touted as a useful early warning signal of irreversible transitions to undesirable ecological regimes. However, while flickering may presage an ecological tipping point, these dynamics also pose unique challenges for human adaptation. In this work, we link an ecological model that can exhibit flickering to a model of human adaptation to a changing environment. This allows us to explore the impact of flickering on the utility of adaptive agents in a coupled socio-environmental system. We highlight the conditions under which flickering causes wellbeing to decline disproportionately, and explore how these dynamics impact the optimal timing of a transformational change that partially decouples wellbeing from environmental variability. The implications of flickering on nomadic communities in Mongolia, artisanal fisheries, and wildfire systems are explored as possible case studies. Flickering, driven in part by climate change and changes to governance systems, may already be impacting communities. We argue that governance interventions investing in adaptive capacity could blunt the negative impact of flickering that can occur as socio-environmental systems pass through tipping points, and therefore contribute to the sustainability of these systems.",

        "abstract": "A growing literature measures \"belief effects\" -- that is, the effect of a change in beliefs on one's actions -- using information provision experiments, where the provision of information is used as an instrument for beliefs. We show that in passive control design experiments with heterogeneous belief effects, using information provision as an instrument may not produce a positive weighted average of belief effects. We propose a \"mover instrumental variables\" (MIV) framework and estimator that attains a positive weighted average of belief effects by inferring the direction of belief updating using the prior. Relative to our preferred MIV, commonly used specifications in the literature produce a form of MIV that overweights individuals with larger prior errors; additionally, some specifications may require additional assumptions to generate positive weights.",

I argue that controlling for non-linearities between a large-dimensional dataset and the latent factors is particularly useful during turbulent times of the business cycle. In simulations, I show that non-linear dimension reduction techniques yield good forecasting performance, especially when data is highly volatile. In an empirical application, I identify a monetary policy as well as an uncertainty shock excluding and including observations of the COVID-19 pandemic. Those two applications suggest that the non-linear FAVAR approaches are capable of dealing with the large outliers caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and yield reliable results in both scenarios.",

        "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.04876",
        "abstract": "Financial volatility obeys two fascinating empirical regularities that apply to various assets, on various markets, and on various time scales: it is fat-tailed (more precisely power-law distributed) and it tends to be clustered in time. Many interesting models have been proposed to account for these regularities, notably agent-based models, which mimic the two empirical laws through a complex mix of nonlinear mechanisms such as traders' switching between trading strategies in highly nonlinear way. This paper explains the two regularities simply in terms of traders' attitudes towards news, an explanation that follows almost by definition of the traditional dichotomy of financial market participants, investors versus speculators, whose behaviors are reduced to their simplest forms. Long-run investors' valuations of an asset are assumed to follow a news-driven random walk, thus capturing the investors' persistent, long memory of fundamental news. Short-term speculators' anticipated returns, on the other hand, are assumed to follow a news-driven autoregressive process, capturing their shorter memory of fundamental news, and, by the same token, the feedback intrinsic to the short-sighted, trend-following (or herding) mindset of speculators. These simple, linear, models of traders' expectations, it is shown, explain the two financial regularities in a generic and robust way. Rational expectations, the dominant model of traders' expectations, is not assumed here, owing to the famous no-speculation, no-trade results",

        "abstract": "This study considers tests for coefficient randomness in predictive regressions. Our focus is on how tests for coefficient randomness are influenced by the persistence of random coefficient. We find that when the random coefficient is stationary, or I(0), Nyblom's (1989) LM test loses its optimality (in terms of power), which is established against the alternative of integrated, or I(1), random coefficient. We demonstrate this by constructing tests that are more powerful than the LM test when random coefficient is stationary, although these tests are dominated in terms of power by the LM test when random coefficient is integrated. This implies that the best test for coefficient randomness differs from context to context, and practitioners should take into account the persistence of potentially random coefficient and choose from several tests accordingly. In particular, we show through theoretical and numerical investigations that the product of the LM test and a Wald-type test proposed in this paper is preferable when there is no prior information on the persistence of potentially random coefficient. This point is illustrated by an empirical application using the U.S. stock returns data.",

        "abstract": "We consider estimation and inference of the effects of a policy in the absence of a control group. We obtain unbiased estimators of individual (heterogeneous) treatment effects and a consistent and asymptotically normal estimator of the average treatment effects, based on forecasting counterfactuals using a short time series of pre-treatment data. We show that the focus should be on forecast unbiasedness rather than accuracy. Correct specification of the forecasting model is not necessary to obtain unbiased estimates of individual treatment effects. Instead, simple basis function (e.g., polynomial time trends) regressions deliver unbiasedness under a broad class of data-generating processes for the individual counterfactuals. Basing the forecasts on a model can introduce misspecification bias and does not necessarily improve performance even under correct specification. Consistency and asymptotic normality of our Forecasted Average Treatment effects (FAT) estimator are attained under an additional assumption that rules out common and unforecastable shocks occurring between the treatment date and the date at which the effect is calculated.",

Image gains from AGMs' media exposure drive shareholders synonymous with a firm, like closely-connected individuals, to support costly prosocial changes, while others, like financial corporations, oppose them. Influence supporting these changes lowers earnings by 3\\%: pursuing the values of (some) shareholders has distributional costs, which the monitoring of large shareholders motivated by heterogeneous preferences could prevent.",

        "abstract": "When a government makes many different policy decisions, lobbying can be viewed as a contest between the government and many different special interest groups. The government fights lobbying by interest groups with its own political capital. In this world, we find that a government wants to `sell protection' -- give favourable treatment in exchange for contributions -- to certain interest groups. It does this in order to build its own `war chest' of political capital, which improves its position in fights with other interest groups. And it does so until it wins all remaining contests with certainty. This stands in contrast to existing models that often view lobbying as driven by information or agency problems.",

We characterize the informed demand, price impact, and information efficiency of prices. Our results offer a theory of informed trading on higher moments of the underlying payoff as a special case. The closed-form informed demand formula prescribes options strategies for trading on any given moment, thereby rationalizing and extending those used for e.g. volatility trading.",

In this paper we report and study the long-run non-transitive behavior of the win ratio and the closely related Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristics Curve (AUC) and argue that their transitivity cannot be taken for granted. Crucially, traditional within-group statistics (i.e., comparison of means) are always transitive, while the WR can detect non-transitivity. Non-transitivity provides valuable information on the stochastic relationship between two treatment groups, which should be tested and reported. We specify the necessary conditions for transitivity, the sufficient conditions for non-transitivity, and demonstrate non-transitivity in a real-life large randomized controlled trial for the WR of time-to-death. Our results can be used to rule out or evaluate the possibility of non-transitivity and show the importance of studying the strength of stochastic relationships.",
