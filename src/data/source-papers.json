        "abstract": "Abstract: Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) system is an infrastructure that exerts considerable impacts on modern society.Traditional NWP system, however, resolves it by solving complex partial differential equations with a huge computing cluster, resulting in tons of carbon emission. Exploring efficient and eco-friendly solutions for NWP attracts interest from Artificial Intelligence (AI) and earth science communities. To narrow the performance gap between the AI-based methods and physic predictor, this work proposes a new transformer-based NWP framework, termed as WeatherFormer, to model the complex spatio-temporal atmosphere dynamics and empowering the capability of data-driven NWP. WeatherFormer innovatively introduces the space-time factorized transformer blocks to decrease the parameters and memory consumption, in which Position-aware Adaptive Fourier Neural Operator (PAFNO) is proposed for location sensible token mixing. Besides, two data augmentation strategies are utilized to boost the performance and decrease training consumption. Extensive experiments on WeatherBench dataset show WeatherFormer achieves superior performance over existing deep learning methods and further approaches the most advanced physical model.",

While large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT dominate current educational research, multimodal capabilities, such as text-to-speech and text-to-image, are less explored. This study uses topic modeling to map the research landscape of multimodal and generative AI in education. An extensive literature search using Dimensions.ai yielded 4175 articles. Employing a topic modeling approach, latent topics were extracted, resulting in 38 interpretable topics organized into 14 thematic areas. Findings indicate a predominant focus on text-to-text models in educational contexts, with other modalities underexplored, overlooking the broader potential of multimodal approaches. The results suggest a research gap, stressing the importance of more balanced attention across different AI modalities and educational levels. In summary, this research provides an overview of current trends in generative AI for education, underlining opportunities for future exploration of multimodal technologies to fully realize the transformative potential of artificial intelligence in education.",

        "abstract": "Abstract: Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) provide a structured framework for decision-making under uncertainty, but their application requires efficient belief updates. Sequential Importance Resampling Particle Filters (SIRPF), also known as Bootstrap Particle Filters, are commonly used as belief updaters in large approximate POMDP solvers, but they face challenges such as particle deprivation and high computational costs as the system's state dimension grows. To address these issues, this study introduces Rao-Blackwellized POMDP (RB-POMDP) approximate solvers and outlines generic methods to apply Rao-Blackwellization in both belief updates and online planning. We compare the performance of SIRPF and Rao-Blackwellized Particle Filters (RBPF) in a simulated localization problem where an agent navigates toward a target in a GPS-denied environment using POMCPOW and RB-POMCPOW planners. Our results not only confirm that RBPFs maintain accurate belief approximations over time with fewer particles, but, more surprisingly, RBPFs combined with quadrature-based integration improve planning quality significantly compared to SIRPF-based planning under the same computational limits.",

We present HAICOSYSTEM, a framework examining AI agent safety within diverse and complex social interactions. HAICOSYSTEM features a modular sandbox environment that simulates multi-turn interactions between human users and AI agents, where the AI agents are equipped with a variety of tools (e.g., patient management platforms) to navigate diverse scenarios (e.g., a user attempting to access other patients' profiles). To examine the safety of AI agents in these interactions, we develop a comprehensive multi-dimensional evaluation framework that uses metrics covering operational, content-related, societal, and legal risks. Through running 1840 simulations based on 92 scenarios across seven domains (e.g., healthcare, finance, education), we demonstrate that HAICOSYSTEM can emulate realistic user-AI interactions and complex tool use by AI agents. Our experiments show that state-of-the-art LLMs, both proprietary and open-sourced, exhibit safety risks in over 50\\% cases, with models generally showing higher risks when interacting with simulated malicious users. Our findings highlight the ongoing challenge of building agents that can safely navigate complex interactions, particularly when faced with malicious users. To foster the AI agent safety ecosystem, we release a code platform that allows practitioners to create custom scenarios, simulate interactions, and evaluate the safety and performance of their agents.",

        "abstract": "Abstract: Dense retrieval systems are commonly used for information retrieval (IR). They rely on learning text representations through an encoder and usually require supervised modeling via labelled data which can be costly to obtain or simply unavailable. In this study, we introduce a novel unsupervised text representation learning technique via instruction-tuning the pre-trained encoder-decoder large language models (LLM) under the dual-encoder retrieval framework. We demonstrate the corpus representation can be augmented by the representations of relevant synthetic queries generated by the instruct-tuned LLM founded on the Rao-Blackwell theorem. Furthermore, we effectively align the query and corpus text representation with self-instructed-tuning. Specifically, we first prompt an open-box pre-trained LLM to follow defined instructions (i.e. question generation and keyword summarization) to generate synthetic queries. Next, we fine-tune the pre-trained LLM with defined instructions and the generated queries that passed quality check. Finally, we generate synthetic queries with the instruction-tuned LLM for each corpora and represent each corpora by weighted averaging the synthetic queries and original corpora embeddings. We evaluate our proposed method under low-resource settings on three English and one German retrieval datasets measuring NDCG@10, MRR@100, Recall@100. We significantly improve the average zero-shot retrieval performance on all metrics, increasing open-box FLAN-T5 model variations by [3.34%, 3.50%] in absolute and exceeding three competitive dense retrievers (i.e. mDPR, T-Systems, mBART-Large), with model of size at least 38% smaller, by 1.96%, 4.62%, 9.52% absolute on NDCG@10.",

        "abstract": "Abstract: With the process of urbanization and the rapid growth of population, the issue of traffic congestion has become an increasingly critical concern. Intelligent transportation systems heavily rely on real-time and precise prediction algorithms to address this problem. While Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) and Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) methods in deep learning have demonstrated high accuracy in predicting road conditions when sufficient data is available, forecasting in road networks with limited data remains a challenging task. This study proposed a novel Spatial-temporal Convolutional Network (TL-GPSTGN) based on graph pruning and transfer learning framework to tackle this issue. Firstly, the essential structure and information of the graph are extracted by analyzing the correlation and information entropy of the road network structure and feature data. By utilizing graph pruning techniques, the adjacency matrix of the graph and the input feature data are processed, resulting in a significant improvement in the model's migration performance. Subsequently, the well-characterized data are inputted into the spatial-temporal graph convolutional network to capture the spatial-temporal relationships and make predictions regarding the road conditions. Furthermore, this study conducts comprehensive testing and validation of the TL-GPSTGN method on real datasets, comparing its prediction performance against other commonly used models under identical conditions. The results demonstrate the exceptional predictive accuracy of TL-GPSTGN on a single dataset, as well as its robust migration performance across different datasets.",

        "abstract": "Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown outstanding performance across numerous real-world tasks. However, the autoregressive nature of these models makes the inference process slow and costly. Speculative decoding has emerged as a promising solution, leveraging a smaller auxiliary model to draft future tokens, which are then validated simultaneously by the larger model, achieving a speed-up of 1-2x. Although speculative decoding matches the same distribution as multinomial sampling, multinomial sampling itself is prone to suboptimal outputs, whereas beam sampling is widely recognized for producing higher-quality results by maintaining multiple candidate sequences at each step. This paper explores the novel integration of speculative decoding with beam sampling. However, there are four key challenges: (1) how to generate multiple sequences from the larger model's distribution given drafts sequences from the small model; (2) how to dynamically optimize the number of beams to balance efficiency and accuracy; (3) how to efficiently verify the multiple drafts in parallel; and (4) how to address the extra memory costs inherent in beam sampling. To address these challenges, we propose dynamic-width speculative beam decoding (DSBD). Specifically, we first introduce a novel draft and verification scheme that generates multiple sequences following the large model's distribution based on beam sampling trajectories from the small model. Then, we introduce an adaptive mechanism to dynamically tune the number of beams based on the context, optimizing efficiency and effectiveness. Besides, we extend tree-based parallel verification to handle multiple trees simultaneously, accelerating the verification process. Finally, we illustrate a simple modification to our algorithm to mitigate the memory overhead of beam sampling...",

Two tasks are jointly trained by combining their respective instruction datasets. When the quality of the task-specific synthetic labels is relatively high (e.g., generated by GPT4- o), Llama 3.1-8B achieves satisfactory performance on the open-ended disease detection task, with a micro F1 score of 0.91. Conversely, when the quality of the task-relevant synthetic labels is relatively low (e.g., from the MIMIC-CXR dataset), fine-tuned Llama 3.1-8B is able to surpass its noisy teacher labels (micro F1 score of 0.67 v.s. 0.63) when calibrated against curated labels, indicating the strong inherent underlying capability of the model. These findings demonstrate the potential of fine-tuning LLMs with synthetic labels, offering a promising direction for future research on LLM specialization in the medical domain.",

        "abstract": "Abstract: The rapid spread of diverse information on online social platforms has prompted both academia and industry to realize the importance of predicting content popularity, which could benefit a wide range of applications, such as recommendation systems and strategic decision-making. Recent works mainly focused on extracting spatiotemporal patterns inherent in the information diffusion process within a given observation period so as to predict its popularity over a future period of time. However, these works often overlook the future popularity trend, as future popularity could either increase exponentially or stagnate, introducing uncertainties to the prediction performance. Additionally, how to transfer the preceding-term dynamics learned from the observed diffusion process into future-term trends remains an unexplored challenge. Against this background, we propose CasFT, which leverages observed information Cascades and dynamic cues extracted via neural ODEs as conditions to guide the generation of Future popularity-increasing Trends through a diffusion model. These generated trends are then combined with the spatiotemporal patterns in the observed information cascade to make the final popularity prediction. Extensive experiments conducted on three real-world datasets demonstrate that CasFT significantly improves the prediction accuracy, compared to state-of-the-art approaches, yielding 2.2%-19.3% improvement across different datasets.",

        "abstract": "Abstract: Information popularity prediction is important yet challenging in various domains, including viral marketing and news recommendations. The key to accurately predicting information popularity lies in subtly modeling the underlying temporal information diffusion process behind observed events of an information cascade, such as the retweets of a tweet. To this end, most existing methods either adopt recurrent networks to capture the temporal dynamics from the first to the last observed event or develop a statistical model based on self-exciting point processes to make predictions. However, information diffusion is intrinsically a complex continuous-time process with irregularly observed discrete events, which is oversimplified using recurrent networks as they fail to capture the irregular time intervals between events, or using self-exciting point processes as they lack flexibility to capture the complex diffusion process. Against this background, we propose ConCat, modeling the Continuous-time dynamics of Cascades for information popularity prediction. On the one hand, it leverages neural Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) to model irregular events of a cascade in continuous time based on the cascade graph and sequential event information. On the other hand, it considers cascade events as neural temporal point processes (TPPs) parameterized by a conditional intensity function which can also benefit the popularity prediction task. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate ConCat on three real-world datasets. Results show that ConCat achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art baselines, yielding a 2.3%-33.2% improvement over the best-performing baselines across the three datasets.",

        "abstract": "Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable advancements in natural language processing, showcasing exceptional performance across various tasks. However, the expensive memory and computational requirements present significant challenges for their practical deployment. Low-bit quantization has emerged as a critical approach to mitigate these challenges by reducing the bit-width of model parameters, activations, and gradients, thus decreasing memory usage and computational demands. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of low-bit quantization methods tailored for LLMs, covering the fundamental principles, system implementations, and algorithmic strategies. An overview of basic concepts and new data formats specific to low-bit LLMs is first introduced, followed by a review of frameworks and systems that facilitate low-bit LLMs across various hardware platforms. Then, we categorize and analyze techniques and toolkits for efficient low-bit training and inference of LLMs. Finally, we conclude with a discussion of future trends and potential advancements of low-bit LLMs. Our systematic overview from basic, system, and algorithm perspectives can offer valuable insights and guidelines for future works to enhance the efficiency and applicability of LLMs through low-bit quantization.",

Retinal fundus images, cirrhosis stages, and heart disease diagnostic predictions have shown promising results through the integration of deep learning techniques for classifying diverse datasets. This study proposes a novel deep learning predictive analysis framework for classifying multiple datasets by pre-processing data from three distinct sources. A hybrid deep learning model combining Residual Networks and Artificial Neural Networks is proposed to detect acute and chronic diseases such as heart diseases, cirrhosis, and retinal conditions, outperforming existing models. Dataset preparation involves aspects such as categorical data transformation, dimensionality reduction, and missing data synthesis. Feature extraction is effectively performed using scaler transformation for categorical datasets and ResNet architecture for image datasets. The resulting features are integrated into a unified classification model. Rigorous experimentation and evaluation resulted in high accuracies of 93%, 99%, and 95% for retinal fundus images, cirrhosis stages, and heart disease diagnostic predictions, respectively. The efficacy of the proposed method is demonstrated through a detailed analysis of F1-score, precision, and recall metrics. This study offers a comprehensive exploration of methodologies and experiments, providing in-depth knowledge of deep learning predictive analysis in electronic health records.",

For mathematical reasoning, LLaMa-SciQ achieved 74.5% accuracy on the GSM8k dataset and 30% on the MATH dataset. However, RAG does not improve performance and even reduces it, likely due to retriever issues or the model's unfamiliarity with context. Despite this, the quantized model shows only a 5% loss in performance, demonstrating significant efficiency improvements.",

This research focuses on adapting and fine-tuning the latest LLM model, PatchTST, to accurately predict AISMR with a lead time of three months. The fine-tuned PatchTST model, trained with historical AISMR data, the Ni\\~no3.4 index, and categorical Indian Ocean Dipole values, outperforms several popular neural network models and statistical models. This fine-tuned LLM model exhibits an exceptionally low RMSE percentage of 0.07% and a Spearman correlation of 0.976. This is particularly impressive, since it is nearly 80% more accurate than the best-performing NN models.

In this paper, we propose a novel pipeline to support and understand the reviewing and decision-making processes of peer review: the PeerArg system combining LLMs with methods from knowledge representation. PeerArg takes in input a set of reviews for a paper and outputs the paper acceptance prediction. We evaluate the performance of the PeerArg pipeline on three different datasets, in comparison with a novel end-2-end LLM that uses few-shot learning to predict paper acceptance given reviews. The results indicate that the end-2-end LLM is capable of predicting paper acceptance from reviews, but a variant of the PeerArg pipeline outperforms this LLM.",

        "abstract": "Abstract: Heuristics are commonly used to tackle diverse search and optimization problems. Design heuristics usually require tedious manual crafting with domain knowledge. Recent works have incorporated large language models (LLMs) into automatic heuristic search leveraging their powerful language and coding capacity. However, existing research focuses on the optimal performance on the target problem as the sole objective, neglecting other criteria such as efficiency and scalability, which are vital in practice. To tackle this challenge, we propose to model heuristic search as a multi-objective optimization problem and consider introducing other practical criteria beyond optimal performance. Due to the complexity of the search space, conventional multi-objective optimization methods struggle to effectively handle multi-objective heuristic search. We propose the first LLM-based multi-objective heuristic search framework, Multi-objective Evolution of Heuristic (MEoH), which integrates LLMs in a zero-shot manner to generate a non-dominated set of heuristics to meet multiple design criteria. We design a new dominance-dissimilarity mechanism for effective population management and selection, which incorporates both code dissimilarity in the search space and dominance in the objective space. MEoH is demonstrated in two well-known combinatorial optimization problems: the online Bin Packing Problem (BPP) and the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). Results indicate that a variety of elite heuristics are automatically generated in a single run, offering more trade-off options than existing methods. It successfully achieves competitive or superior performance while improving efficiency up to 10 times. Moreover, we also observe that the multi-objective search introduces novel insights into heuristic design and leads to the discovery of diverse heuristics.",

Although businesses have embedded AI into their day-to-day processes, they lack a unified approach for mitigating its potential risks. This paper introduces a framework ensuring that AI must be ethical, controllable, viable, and desirable. Balancing these factors ensures the design of a framework that addresses its trade-offs, such as balancing performance against explainability. A successful framework provides practical advice for businesses to meet regulatory requirements in sectors such as finance and healthcare, where it is critical to comply with standards like GPDR and the EU AI Act. Different case studies validate this framework by integrating AI in both academic and practical environments. For instance, large language models are cost-effective alternatives for generating synthetic opinions that emulate attitudes to environmental issues. These case studies demonstrate how having a structured framework could enhance transparency and maintain performance levels as shown from the alignment between synthetic and expected distributions. This alignment is quantified using metrics like Chi-test scores, normalized mutual information, and Jaccard indexes. Future research should explore the framework's empirical validation in diverse industrial settings further, ensuring the model's scalability and adaptability.",

Traditional workflows involve exhaustive literature reviews, formula optimization, and iterative testing, leading to inefficiencies in research. In response, we introduce the Traffic Research Agent (TR-Agent), an AI-driven system designed to autonomously develop and refine traffic models through an iterative, closed-loop process. Specifically, we divide the research pipeline into four key stages: idea generation, theory formulation, theory evaluation, and iterative optimization; and construct TR-Agent with four corresponding modules: Idea Generator, Code Generator, Evaluator, and Analyzer. Working in synergy, these modules retrieve knowledge from external resources, generate novel ideas, implement and debug models, and finally assess them on the evaluation datasets. Furthermore, the system continuously refines these models based on iterative feedback, enhancing research efficiency and model performance. Experimental results demonstrate that TR-Agent achieves significant performance improvements across multiple traffic models, including the Intelligent Driver Model (IDM) for car following, the MOBIL lane-changing model, and the Lighthill-Whitham-Richards (LWR) traffic flow model. Additionally, TR-Agent provides detailed explanations for its optimizations, allowing researchers to verify and build upon its improvements easily. This flexibility makes the framework a powerful tool for researchers in transportation and beyond. To further support research and collaboration, we have open-sourced both the code and data used in our experiments, facilitating broader access and enabling continued advancements in the field.",

Our method models the relative position and orientation vectors between arbitrary views and clinically defined ICE views in a spatial coordinate system, guiding users on how to manipulate the ICE catheter to transition from the current view to the desired view over time. Operating in a closed-loop configuration, the system continuously predicts and updates the necessary catheter manipulations, ensuring seamless integration into existing clinical workflows.

Through extensive evaluation, we find that most RPAs behave significant performance gaps toward different conflict requests. To elucidate the reasons, we conduct an in-depth representation-level analysis of RPAs under various conflict scenarios. Our findings reveal the existence of rejection regions and direct response regions within the model's forwarding representation, and thus influence the RPA's final response behavior.

The system enables proctors to work more effectively to identify suspicious moments in videos.

To assess the efficacy of the approach, the resulting network is compared against the B-CNN, a convolutional neural network tailored for hierarchical classification tasks, on the CIFAR10, CIFAR100 (where it has been originally and recently proposed before being adopted and tuned for multiple real-world applications) and Fashion-MNIST benchmarks.

        "abstract": "Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used in both industry and academia for various tasks, yet evaluating the consistency of generated text responses continues to be a challenge. Traditional metrics like ROUGE and BLEU show a weak correlation with human judgment. More sophisticated metrics using Natural Language Inference (NLI) have shown improved correlations but are complex to implement, require domain-specific training due to poor cross-domain generalization, and lack explainability. More recently, prompt-based metrics using LLMs as evaluators have emerged; while they are easier to implement, they still lack explainability and depend on task-specific prompts, which limits their generalizability. This work introduces Automated eXplainable Consistency Evaluation using LLMs (AXCEL), a prompt-based consistency metric which offers explanations for the consistency scores by providing detailed reasoning and pinpointing inconsistent text spans. AXCEL is also a generalizable metric which can be adopted to multiple tasks without changing the prompt. AXCEL outperforms both non-prompt and prompt-based state-of-the-art (SOTA) metrics in detecting inconsistencies across summarization by 8.7%, free text generation by 6.2%, and data-to-text conversion tasks by 29.4%. We also evaluate the influence of underlying LLMs on prompt based metric performance and recalibrate the SOTA prompt-based metrics with the latest LLMs for fair comparison. Further, we show that AXCEL demonstrates strong performance using open source LLMs.",

        "abstract": "Abstract: Data selection is of great significance in pre-training large language models, given the variation in quality within the large-scale available training corpora. To achieve this, researchers are currently investigating the use of data influence to measure the importance of data instances, $i.e.,$ a high influence score indicates that incorporating this instance to the training set is likely to enhance the model performance. Consequently, they select the top-$k$ instances with the highest scores. However, this approach has several limitations. (1) Computing the influence of all available data is time-consuming. (2) The selected data instances are not diverse enough, which may hinder the pre-trained model's ability to generalize effectively to various downstream tasks. In this paper, we introduce \\texttt{Quad}, a data selection approach that considers both quality and diversity by using data influence to achieve state-of-the-art pre-training results. In particular, noting that attention layers capture extensive semantic details, we have adapted the accelerated $iHVP$ computation methods for attention layers, enhancing our ability to evaluate the influence of data, $i.e.,$ its quality. For the diversity, \\texttt{Quad} clusters the dataset into similar data instances within each cluster and diverse instances across different clusters. For each cluster, if we opt to select data from it, we take some samples to evaluate the influence to prevent processing all instances. To determine which clusters to select, we utilize the classic Multi-Armed Bandit method, treating each cluster as an arm. This approach favors clusters with highly influential instances (ensuring high quality) or clusters that have been selected less frequently (ensuring diversity), thereby well balancing between quality and diversity.",

While there are important advantages to treating math in a purely symbolic manner, we here hypothesize that there are benefits to treating math as situated linguistic communication and that language models are well suited for this goal, in ways that are not fully appreciated. We illustrate these points with two case studies. First, we ran an experiment in which we found that language models interpret the equals sign in a humanlike way -- generating systematically different word problems for the same underlying equation arranged in different ways. Second, we found that language models prefer proofs to be ordered in naturalistic ways, even though other orders would be logically equivalent. We advocate for AI systems that learn from and represent the communicative intentions latent in human-generated math.",

Active Debris Removal (ADR) has emerged as a promising approach to address this issue, utilising Orbital Transfer Vehicles (OTVs) to facilitate debris deorbiting, thereby reducing future collision risks. However, ADR missions are substantially complex, necessitating accurate planning to make the missions economically viable and technically effective. Moreover, these servicing missions require a high level of autonomous capability to plan under evolving orbital conditions and changing mission requirements. In this paper, an autonomous decision-planning model based on Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) is developed to train an OTV to plan optimal debris removal sequencing. It is shown that using the proposed framework, the agent can find optimal mission plans and learn to update the planning autonomously to include risk handling of debris with high collision risk.",

        "abstract": "Abstract: One of the key issues contributing to inefficiency in Puskesmas is the time-consuming nature of doctor-patient interactions. Doctors need to conduct thorough consultations, which include diagnosing the patient's condition, providing treatment advice, and transcribing detailed notes into medical records. In regions with diverse linguistic backgrounds, doctors often have to ask clarifying questions, further prolonging the process. While diagnosing is essential, transcription and summarization can often be automated using AI to improve time efficiency and help doctors enhance care quality and enable early diagnosis and intervention. This paper proposes a solution using a localized large language model (LLM) to transcribe, translate, and summarize doctor-patient conversations. We utilize the Whisper model for transcription and GPT-3 to summarize them into the ePuskemas medical records format. This system is implemented as an add-on to an existing web browser extension, allowing doctors to fill out patient forms while talking. By leveraging this solution for real-time transcription, translation, and summarization, doctors can improve the turnaround time for patient care while enhancing the quality of records, which become more detailed and insightful for future visits. This innovation addresses challenges like overcrowded facilities and the administrative burden on healthcare providers in Indonesia. We believe this solution will help doctors save time, provide better care, and produce more accurate medical records, representing a significant step toward modernizing healthcare and ensuring patients receive timely, high-quality care, even in resource-constrained settings.",

        "abstract": "Abstract: Real-life medical data is often multimodal and incomplete, fueling the growing need for advanced deep learning models capable of integrating them efficiently. The use of diverse modalities, including histopathology slides, MRI, and genetic data, offers unprecedented opportunities to improve prognosis prediction and to unveil new treatment pathways. Contrastive learning, widely used for deriving representations from paired data in multimodal tasks, assumes that different views contain the same task-relevant information and leverages only shared information. This assumption becomes restrictive when handling medical data since each modality also harbors specific knowledge relevant to downstream tasks. We introduce DRIM, a new multimodal method for capturing these shared and unique representations, despite data sparsity. More specifically, given a set of modalities, we aim to encode a representation for each one that can be divided into two components: one encapsulating patient-related information common across modalities and the other, encapsulating modality-specific details. This is achieved by increasing the shared information among different patient modalities while minimizing the overlap between shared and unique components within each modality. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms on glioma patients survival prediction tasks, while being robust to missing modalities.

        "abstract": "Abstract: Scaling model size significantly challenges the deployment and inference of Large Language Models (LLMs). Due to the redundancy in LLM weights, recent research has focused on pushing weight-only quantization to extremely low-bit (even down to 2 bits). It reduces memory requirements, optimizes storage costs, and decreases memory bandwidth needs during inference. However, due to numerical representation limitations, traditional scalar-based weight quantization struggles to achieve such extreme low-bit. Recent research on Vector Quantization (VQ) for LLMs has demonstrated the potential for extremely low-bit model quantization by compressing vectors into indices using lookup tables. In this paper, we introduce Vector Post-Training Quantization (VPTQ) for extremely low-bit quantization of LLMs. We use Second-Order Optimization to formulate the LLM VQ problem and guide our quantization algorithm design by solving the optimization. We further refine the weights using Channel-Independent Second-Order Optimization for a granular VQ. In addition, by decomposing the optimization problem, we propose a brief and effective codebook initialization algorithm. We also extend VPTQ to support residual and outlier quantization, which enhances model accuracy and further compresses the model. Our experimental results show that VPTQ reduces model quantization perplexity by $0.01$-$0.34$ on LLaMA-2, $0.38$-$0.68$ on Mistral-7B, $4.41$-$7.34$ on LLaMA-3 over SOTA at 2-bit, with an average accuracy improvement of $0.79$-$1.5\\%$ on LLaMA-2, $1\\%$ on Mistral-7B, $11$-$22\\%$ on LLaMA-3 on QA tasks on average.

We then compute image-specific heatmaps that visually indicate the areas that correspond to feature-maps with higher AIS scores. These maps provide an intuitive explanation of which image areas are more important when it is compared to other images in a cohort. We observe a correspondence between these heatmaps and saliency maps produced by a gaze-prediction model. However, in some cases, meaningful differences emerge, as the dimensions relevant for comparison are not necessarily the most visually salient. To conclude, Alignment Importance improves prediction of human similarity judgments from DNN embeddings, and provides interpretable insights into the relevant information in image space.",

We also show that the SSI retrieved from Heliosat exhibits large biases in mountain regions, and that training and fine-tuning our retrieval models on SSI data from ground stations strongly reduces these biases, outperforming Heliosat. Furthermore, we quantify the relative importance of the Meteosat channels and other predictor variables like solar zenith angle for the accuracy of our deep learning SSI retrieval model in different cloud conditions.

The methods take clear-sky irradiance, cloud index, re-analyzed GHI and temperature data from the MERRA-2 database, and date-time as inputs for GHI estimation models, including LightGBM, LSTM, Informer, and Transformer. These are benchmarked with the estimate from the SolCast service by evaluation of 15-minute ground GHI data from 53 ground stations over 1.5 years during 2022-2023. The results show that the four models have competitive performances and outperform the SolCast service. The best model is LightGBM, with an MAE of 78.58 W/sqm and RMSE of 118.97 W/sqm. Obtaining re-analyzed MERRA-2 data for Thailand is not economically feasible for deployment. When removing these features, the Informer model has a winning performance of 78.67 W/sqm in MAE. The obtained performance aligns with existing literature by taking the climate zone and time granularity of data into consideration.

Unlike conventional classification tasks, we identify within-class variation as a critical challenge in AD detection: individuals with AD exhibit a spectrum of cognitive impairments. Given that many AD detection tasks lack fine-grained labels, simplistic binary classification may overlook two crucial aspects: within-class differences and instance-level imbalance. The former compels the model to map AD samples with varying degrees of impairment to a single diagnostic label, disregarding certain changes in cognitive function. While the latter biases the model towards overrepresented severity levels. This work presents early efforts to address these challenges. We propose two novel methods: Soft Target Distillation (SoTD) and Instance-level Re-balancing (InRe), targeting two problems respectively. Experiments on the ADReSS and ADReSSo datasets demonstrate that the proposed methods significantly improve detection accuracy. Further analysis reveals that SoTD effectively harnesses the strengths of multiple component models, while InRe substantially alleviates model over-fitting.

Electricity is traditionally managed by anticipating demand and intermittent production (wind, solar) and matching flexible production (hydro, nuclear, coal and gas). Accurate forecasting of electricity load and renewable production is therefore essential to ensure grid performance and stability. Both are highly dependent on meteorological variables (temperature, wind, sunshine). These dependencies are complex and difficult to model. On the one hand, spatial variations do not have a uniform impact because population, industry, and wind and solar farms are not evenly distributed across the territory. On the other hand, temporal variations can have delayed effects on load (due to the thermal inertia of buildings). With access to observations from different weather stations and simulated data from meteorological models, we believe that both phenomena can be modeled together. In today's state-of-the-art load forecasting models, the spatio-temporal modeling of the weather is fixed. In this work, we aim to take advantage of the automated representation and spatio-temporal feature extraction capabilities of deep neural networks to improve spatio-temporal weather modeling for load forecasting.

However, the privacy concerns surrounding patient data present a major barrier to the widespread adoption of AI in medical imaging, as large, diverse training datasets are essential for developing accurate, generalizable, and robust Artificial intelligence models. Federated Learning (FL) offers a solution that enables organizations to train AI models collaboratively without sharing sensitive data. federated learning exchanges model training information, such as gradients, between the participating sites. Despite its promise, federated learning is still in its developmental stages and faces several challenges. Notably, sensitive information can still be inferred from the gradients shared during model training. Quantifying AI models' uncertainty is vital due to potential data distribution shifts post-deployment, which can affect model performance. Uncertainty quantification (UQ) in FL is particularly challenging due to data heterogeneity across participating sites. This review provides a comprehensive examination of FL, privacy-preserving FL (PPFL), and UQ in FL. We identify key gaps in current FL methodologies and propose future research directions to enhance data privacy and trustworthiness in medical imaging applications.",

This paper introduces Hopfield Encoding Networks (HEN), a framework that integrates encoded neural representations into MHNs to improve pattern separability and reduce meta-stable states. We show that HEN can also be used for retrieval in the context of hetero association of images with natural language queries, thus removing the limitation of requiring access to partial content in the same domain.

However, improving their accuracy in generating correct and reliable code remains challenging. Numerous prompt engineering techniques (PETs) have been developed to address this, but no single approach is universally optimal. Selecting the right PET for each query is difficult for two primary reasons: (1) interactive prompting techniques may not consistently deliver the expected benefits, especially for simpler queries, and (2) current automated prompt engineering methods lack adaptability and fail to fully utilize multi-stage responses. To overcome these challenges, we propose PET-Select, a PET-agnostic selection model that uses code complexity as a proxy to classify queries and select the most appropriate PET. By incorporating contrastive learning, PET-Select effectively distinguishes between simple and complex problems, allowing it to choose PETs that are best suited for each query's complexity level. Our evaluations on the MBPP and HumanEval benchmarks using GPT-3.5 Turbo and GPT-4o show up to a 1.9% improvement in pass@1 accuracy, along with a 74.8% reduction in token usage.

Yet, they struggle with task-oriented prompts due to a lack of specific prior knowledge of the task answers. The current state-of-the-art approach, PAL, utilizes code generation to address this issue. However, PAL depends on manually crafted prompt templates and examples while still producing inaccurate results. In this work, we present TITAN-a novel strategy designed to enhance LLMs' performance on task-oriented prompts. TITAN achieves this by generating scripts using a universal approach and zero-shot learning. Unlike existing methods, TITAN eliminates the need for detailed task-specific instructions and extensive manual efforts. TITAN enhances LLMs' performance on various tasks by utilizing their analytical and code-generation capabilities in a streamlined process. TITAN employs two key techniques: (1) step-back prompting to extract the task's input specifications and (2) chain-of-thought prompting to identify required procedural steps. This information is used to improve the LLMs' code-generation process. TITAN further refines the generated script through post-processing and the script is executed to retrieve the final answer. Our comprehensive evaluation demonstrates TITAN's effectiveness in a diverse set of tasks. On average, TITAN outperforms the state-of-the-art zero-shot approach by 7.6% and 3.9% when paired with GPT-3.5 and GPT-4. Overall, without human annotation, TITAN achieves state-of-the-art performance in 8 out of 11 cases while only marginally losing to few-shot approaches (which needed human intervention) on three occasions by small margins.

However, most of these explanation methods appropriate attribution scores to pixels independently, even though both humans and DNNs make decisions by analyzing a set of closely related pixels simultaneously. Hence, the attribution score of a pixel should be evaluated jointly by considering itself and its structurally-similar pixels. We propose a method called IProp, which models each pixel's individual attribution score as a source of explanatory information and explains the image prediction through the dynamic propagation of information across all pixels. To formulate the information propagation, IProp adopts the Markov Reward Process, which guarantees convergence, and the final status indicates the desired pixels' attribution scores. Furthermore, IProp is compatible with any existing attribution-based explanation method. Extensive experiments on various explanation methods and DNN models verify that IProp significantly improves them on a variety of interpretability metrics.",

This community-wide enthusiasm has sparked a plethora of new methods. Nevertheless, a systematic study to understand their performance and suitable application scenarios is lacking, leaving questions like when to apply PETL and which method to use largely unanswered. In this paper, we conduct a unifying empirical study of representative PETL methods in the context of Vision Transformers. We systematically tune their hyper-parameters to fairly compare their accuracy on downstream tasks. Our study not only offers a valuable user guide but also unveils several new insights. First, if tuned carefully, different PETL methods can obtain quite similar accuracy in the low-shot benchmark VTAB-1K. This includes simple methods like FT the bias terms that were reported inferior. Second, though with similar accuracy, we find that PETL methods make different mistakes and high-confidence predictions, likely due to their different inductive biases. Such an inconsistency (or complementariness) opens up the opportunity for ensemble methods, and we make preliminary attempts at this. Third, going beyond the commonly used low-shot tasks, we find that PETL is also useful in many-shot regimes -- it achieves comparable and sometimes better accuracy than full FT, using much fewer learnable parameters. Last but not least, we investigate PETL's ability to preserve a pre-trained model's robustness to distribution shifts (e.g., a CLIP backbone). Perhaps not surprisingly, PETL methods outperform full FT alone. However, with weight-space ensembles, the fully FT model can achieve a better balance between downstream and out-of-distribution performance, suggesting a future research direction for PETL.",

Many scholars argue that recommenders may lead to detrimental effects, such as bias-amplification deriving from the feedback loop between algorithmic suggestions and users' choices. Nonetheless, the extent to which recommenders influence changes in users leaning remains uncertain. In this context, it is important to provide a controlled environment for evaluating the recommendation algorithm before deployment. To address this, we propose a stochastic simulation framework that mimics user-recommender system interactions in a long-term scenario. In particular, we simulate the user choices by formalizing a user model, which comprises behavioral aspects, such as the user resistance towards the recommendation algorithm and their inertia in relying on the received suggestions. Additionally, we introduce two novel metrics for quantifying the algorithm's impact on user preferences, specifically in terms of drift over time. We conduct an extensive evaluation on multiple synthetic datasets, aiming at testing the robustness of our framework when considering different scenarios and hyper-parameters setting. The experimental results prove that the proposed methodology is effective in detecting and quantifying the drift over the users preferences by means of the simulation.

Progressively, drug repurposing is an emergent and powerful strategy with saving cost, time, and labor.

We perform the QSAR modeling by employing various machine learning regression approaches to identify the potential inhibitors against COVID 19. Our findings with best scores of R2 and RMSE demonstrated that our proposed Decision Tree Regression (DTR) model is the most appropriate model to explore the potential inhibitors.

Most state-of-the-art SFDA methods for object detection have been proposed for Faster-RCNN, a detector that is known to have high computational complexity. This paper focuses on domain adaptation techniques for real-world vision systems, particularly for the YOLO family of single-shot detectors known for their fast baselines and practical applications.

A challenge with self-training using a mean-teacher architecture in the absence of labels is the rapid decline of accuracy due to noisy or drifting pseudo-labels. To address this issue, a teacher-to-student communication mechanism is introduced to help stabilize the training and reduce the reliance on annotated target data for model selection.

Recently, several automated spatio-temporal forecasting methods have been proposed to automatically search the optimal neural network architecture for capturing complex spatio-temporal dependencies. However, the existing automated approaches suffer from expensive neural architecture search overhead, which hinders their practical use and the further exploration of diverse spatio-temporal operators in a finer granularity. In this paper, we propose AutoSTF, a decoupled automatic neural architecture search framework for cost-effective automated spatio-temporal forecasting. From the efficiency perspective, we first decouple the mixed search space into temporal space and spatial space and respectively devise representation compression and parameter-sharing schemes to mitigate the parameter explosion. The decoupled spatio-temporal search not only expedites the model optimization process but also leaves new room for more effective spatio-temporal dependency modeling. From the effectiveness perspective, we propose a multi-patch transfer module to jointly capture multi-granularity temporal dependencies and extend the spatial search space to enable finer-grained layer-wise spatial dependency search. Extensive experiments on eight datasets demonstrate the superiority of AutoSTF in terms of both accuracy and efficiency.

In this paper, we propose a novel JSCC architecture, named MambaJSCC, that achieves state-of-the-art performance with low computational and parameter overhead. MambaJSCC utilizes the visual state space model with channel adaptation (VSSM-CA) blocks as its backbone for transmitting images over wireless channels, where the VSSM-CA primarily consists of the generalized state space models (GSSM) and the zero-parameter, zero-computational channel adaptation method (CSI-ReST). We design the GSSM module, leveraging reversible matrix transformations to express generalized scan expanding operations, and theoretically prove that two GSSM modules can effectively capture global information. We discover that GSSM inherently possesses the ability to adapt to channels, a form of endogenous intelligence. Based on this, we design the CSI-ReST method, which injects channel state information (CSI) into the initial state of GSSM to utilize its native response, and into the residual state to mitigate CSI forgetting, enabling effective channel adaptation without introducing additional computational and parameter overhead. Experimental results show that MambaJSCC not only outperforms existing JSCC methods (e.g., SwinJSCC) across various scenarios but also significantly reduces parameter size, computational overhead, and inference delay.",

SL allows resource-constrained clients to collaboratively train ML models with a server, reduce their computational overhead, and enable data privacy by avoiding raw data sharing. Although QML with SL has been studied, the problem remains open in resource-constrained environments where clients lack quantum computing capabilities. Additionally, data privacy leakage between client and server in SL poses risks of reconstruction attacks on the server side. To address these issues, we propose Hybrid Quantum Split Learning (HQSL), an application of Hybrid QML in SL. HQSL enables classical clients to train models with a hybrid quantum server and curtails reconstruction attacks. In addition, we introduce a novel qubit-efficient data-loading technique for designing a quantum layer in HQSL, minimizing both the number of qubits and circuit depth. Experiments on five datasets demonstrate HQSL's feasibility and ability to enhance classification performance compared to its classical models. Notably, HQSL achieves mean improvements of over 3% in both accuracy and F1-score for the Fashion-MNIST dataset, and over 1.5% in both metrics for the Speech Commands dataset. We expand these studies to include up to 100 clients, confirming HQSL's scalability. Moreover, we introduce a noise-based defense mechanism to tackle reconstruction attacks on the server side. Overall, HQSL enables classical clients to collaboratively train their models with a hybrid quantum server, leveraging quantum advantages while improving model performance and security against data privacy leakage-related reconstruction attacks.",

However, learning robust object representations for UAV tracking is especially challenging in complex dynamic environments, when confronted with aspect ratio change and occlusion. These challenges severely alter the original information of the object. To handle the above issues, this work proposes a novel progressive representation learning framework for UAV tracking, i.e., PRL-Track. Specifically, PRL-Track is divided into coarse representation learning and fine representation learning. For coarse representation learning, two innovative regulators, which rely on appearance and semantic information, are designed to mitigate appearance interference and capture semantic information. Furthermore, for fine representation learning, a new hierarchical modeling generator is developed to intertwine coarse object representations. Exhaustive experiments demonstrate that the proposed PRL-Track delivers exceptional performance on three authoritative UAV tracking benchmarks. Real-world tests indicate that the proposed PRL-Track realizes superior tracking performance with 42.6 frames per second on the typical UAV platform equipped with an edge smart camera.

Existing research in GNN transfer learning overlooks discrepancies in distribution among various graph datasets, facing challenges when transferring across different distributions. How to effectively adopt a well-trained GNN to new graphs with varying feature and structural distributions remains an under-explored problem.

Moreover, we introduce low-rank adaptation by injecting a small trainable GNN alongside the pre-trained one, effectively bridging structural distribution gaps while mitigating the catastrophic forgetting. Additionally, a structure-aware regularization objective is proposed to enhance the adaptability of the pre-trained GNN to target graph with scarce supervision labels.

A higher threshold reduces false positives but may result in missing a significant portion of true positives. A lower threshold can increase detection recall but may also result in more false positives. Because of this, using a preset global threshold (e.g., 0.5) applied to all the bounding box candidates may lead to suboptimal solutions. In this paper, we propose a Test-time Self-guided Bounding-box Propagation (TSBP) method, leveraging Earth Mover's Distance (EMD) to enhance object detection in histology images. TSBP utilizes bounding boxes with high confidence to influence those with low confidence, leveraging visual similarities between them. This propagation mechanism enables bounding boxes to be selected in a controllable, explainable, and robust manner, which surpasses the effectiveness of using simple thresholds and uncertainty calibration methods. Importantly, TSBP does not necessitate additional labeled samples for model training or parameter estimation, unlike calibration methods. We conduct experiments on gland detection and cell detection tasks in histology images. The results show that our proposed TSBP significantly improves detection outcomes when working in conjunction with state-of-the-art deep learning-based detection networks.

To further ensure the GNN's utility, the Rectify stage devises a gradient approximation method to estimate the model's gradient on the remaining dataset, which is then used to enhance model performance. Overall, ETR achieves graph unlearning without additional training or full training data access, significantly reducing computational overhead and preserving data privacy.

Online RL has been adopted for radio resource management (RRM), taking over traditional schemes. However, due to its reliance on online interaction with the environment, its role becomes limited in practical, real-world problems where online interaction is not feasible. In addition, traditional RL stands short in front of the uncertainties and risks in real-world stochastic environments. In this manner, we propose an offline and distributional RL scheme for the RRM problem, enabling offline training using a static dataset without any interaction with the environment and considering the sources of uncertainties using the distributions of the return. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme outperforms conventional resource management models. In addition, it is the only scheme that surpasses online RL and achieves a $16 \\%$ gain over online RL.",

Therefore, unmanned aerial vehicles are increasingly deployed to inspect powerlines, resulting in a substantial stream of visual data which requires swift and accurate processing. Deep learning methods have become widely popular for this task, proving to be a valuable asset in fault detection.

Inspired by advances in probabilistic world models for reinforcement learning, we propose a standalone Kalman filter layer that performs closed-form Gaussian inference in linear state-space models and train it end-to-end within a model-free architecture to maximize returns. Similar to efficient linear recurrent layers, the Kalman filter layer processes sequential data using a parallel scan, which scales logarithmically with the sequence length. By design, Kalman filter layers are a drop-in replacement for other recurrent layers in standard model-free architectures, but importantly they include an explicit mechanism for probabilistic filtering of the latent state representation. Experiments in a wide variety of tasks with partial observability show that Kalman filter layers excel in problems where uncertainty reasoning is key for decision-making, outperforming other stateful models.",

For solving the relatively high computational cost for the existing approaches, works based on anchor have been presented recently. Even with acceptable clustering performance, these methods tend to map the original representation from multiple views into a fixed shared graph based on the original dataset. However, most studies ignore the discriminative property of the learned anchors, which ruin the representation capability of the built model. Moreover, the complementary information among anchors across views is neglected to be ensured by simply learning the shared anchor graph without considering the quality of view-specific anchors.

We learn discriminative view-specific feature representations according to the original dataset and build anchors from different views based on these representations, which increase the quality of the shared anchor graph. The discriminative feature learning and consensus anchor graph construction are integrated into a unified framework to improve each other for realizing the refinement. The optimal anchors from multiple views and the consensus anchor graph are learned with the orthogonal constraints. We give an iterative algorithm to deal with the formulated problem.

In this work, we propose a Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL) framework, introducing a novel multi-view pseudo-labeling method that leverages both acoustic and linguistic characteristics to select the most confident data for training the classification model. Acoustically, unlabeled data are compared to labeled data using the Frechet audio distance, calculated from embeddings generated by multiple audio encoders. Linguistically, large language models are prompted to revise automatic speech recognition transcriptions and predict labels based on our proposed task-specific knowledge. High-confidence data are identified when pseudo-labels from both sources align, while mismatches are treated as low-confidence data. A bimodal classifier is then trained to iteratively label the low-confidence data until a predefined criterion is met. We evaluate our SSL framework on emotion recognition and dementia detection tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves competitive performance compared to fully supervised learning using only 30% of the labeled data and significantly outperforms two selected baselines.",

Effective collision avoidance demands continuous monitoring and adaptive decision-making. While replanning at every timestep could ensure safety, it introduces substantial computational overhead due to the repetitive prediction of overlapping state sequences -- a process that is particularly costly with diffusion models, known for their intensive iterative sampling procedure. We propose an adaptive generative planning approach that dynamically adjusts replanning frequency based on the uncertainty of action predictions. Our method minimizes the need for frequent, computationally expensive, and redundant replanning while maintaining robust collision avoidance performance. In experiments, we obtain a 13.5% increase in the mean trajectory length and a 12.7% increase in mean reward over long-horizon planning, indicating a reduction in collision rates and an improved ability to navigate the environment safely.",

We cannot know. State-of-the-art large language models are stateless -- they maintain no internal memory or state. Given a prompt, they generate a sequence of tokens as an output using an autoregressive process. As a consequence, they cannot reason about counterfactual alternatives to tokens they have generated in the past. In this work, our goal is to enhance them with this functionality. To this end, we develop a causal model of token generation that builds upon the Gumbel-Max structural causal model. Our model allows any large language model to perform counterfactual token generation at almost no cost in comparison with vanilla token generation, it is embarrassingly simple to implement, and it does not require any fine-tuning nor prompt engineering. We implement our model on Llama 3 8B-instruct and conduct both qualitative and quantitative analyses of counterfactually generated text.

GeoBiked is curated to contain 4 355 bicycle images, annotated with structural and technical features and is used to investigate two automated labeling techniques: The utilization of consolidated latent features (Hyperfeatures) from image-generation models to detect geometric correspondences (e.g. the position of the wheel center) in structural images and the generation of diverse text descriptions for structural images. GPT-4o, a vision-language-model (VLM), is instructed to analyze images and produce diverse descriptions aligned with the system-prompt. By representing technical images as Diffusion-Hyperfeatures, drawing geometric correspondences between them is possible. The detection accuracy of geometric points in unseen samples is improved by presenting multiple annotated source images. GPT-4o has sufficient capabilities to generate accurate descriptions of technical images. Grounding the generation only on images leads to diverse descriptions but causes hallucinations, while grounding it on categorical labels restricts the diversity. Using both as input balances creativity and accuracy. Successfully using Hyperfeatures for geometric correspondence suggests that this approach can be used for general point-detection and annotation tasks in technical images. Labeling such images with text descriptions using VLMs is possible, but dependent on the models detection capabilities, careful prompt-engineering and the selection of input information.

The state-of-the-art for processing raw inputs, though, are deep neural networks (DNNs), nowadays often based off from multimodal foundation models. These automatically learn rich representations of concepts and respective reasoning. Unfortunately, the learned qualitative knowledge is opaque, preventing easy inspection, validation, or adaptation against available QR models. So far, it is possible to associate pre-defined concepts with latent representations of DNNs, but extractable relations are mostly limited to semantic similarity. As a next step towards QR for validation and verification of DNNs: Concretely, we propose a method that extracts the learned superclass hierarchy from a multimodal DNN for a given set of leaf concepts. Under the hood we (1) obtain leaf concept embeddings using the DNN's textual input modality; (2) apply hierarchical clustering to them, using that DNNs encode semantic similarities via vector distances; and (3) label the such-obtained parent concepts using search in available ontologies from QR. An initial evaluation study shows that meaningful ontological class hierarchies can be extracted from state-of-the-art foundation models. Furthermore, we demonstrate how to validate and verify a DNN's learned representations against given ontologies. Lastly, we discuss potential future applications in the context of QR.",

        "abstract": "arXiv:2409.17115v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: Large language model pre-training has traditionally relied on human experts to craft heuristics for improving the corpora quality, resulting in numerous rules developed to date. However, these rules lack the flexibility to address the unique characteristics of individual example effectively. Meanwhile, applying tailored rules to every example is impractical for human experts. In this paper, we demonstrate that even small language models, with as few as 0.3B parameters, can exhibit substantial data refining capabilities comparable to those of human experts. We introduce Programming Every Example (ProX), a novel framework that treats data refinement as a programming task, enabling models to refine corpora by generating and executing fine-grained operations, such as string normalization, for each individual example at scale. Experimental results show that models pre-trained on ProX-curated data outperform either original data or data filtered by other selection methods by more than 2% across various downstream benchmarks. Its effectiveness spans various model sizes and pre-training corpora, including C4, RedPajama-V2, and FineWeb. Furthermore, ProX exhibits significant potential in domain-specific continual pre-training: without domain specific design, models trained on OpenWebMath refined by ProX outperform human-crafted rule-based methods, improving average accuracy by 7.6% over Mistral-7B, with 14.6% for Llama-2-7B and 20.3% for CodeLlama-7B, all within 10B tokens to be comparable to models like Llemma-7B trained on 200B tokens. Further analysis highlights that ProX significantly saves training FLOPs, offering a promising path for efficient LLM pre-training.We are open-sourcing ProX with >100B corpus, models, and sharing all training and implementation details for reproducible research and future innovation.

Inspired by the rich history of research in industrial ''Design for Assembly'', we introduce a novel problem: Generative Design-for-Robot-Assembly (GDfRA). The task is to generate an assembly based on a natural language prompt (e.g., ''giraffe'') and an image of available physical components, such as 3D-printed blocks. The output is an assembly, a spatial arrangement of these components, and instructions for a robot to build this assembly. The output must 1) resemble the requested object and 2) be reliably assembled by a 6 DoF robot arm with a suction gripper. We then present Blox-Net, a GDfRA system that combines generative vision language models with well-established methods in computer vision, simulation, perturbation analysis, motion planning, and physical robot experimentation to solve a class of GDfRA problems with minimal human supervision. Blox-Net achieved a Top-1 accuracy of 63.5% in the ''recognizability'' of its designed assemblies (eg, resembling giraffe as judged by a VLM). These designs, after automated perturbation redesign, were reliably assembled by a robot, achieving near-perfect success across 10 consecutive assembly iterations with human intervention only during reset prior to assembly. Surprisingly, this entire design process from textual word (''giraffe'') to reliable physical assembly is performed with zero human intervention.",

In this paper, we provide an in-depth analysis of neural network and transformer-based compression techniques to answer this question. We compare traditional text compression systems with neural network and LLM-based text compression methods. Although LLM-based systems significantly outperform conventional compression methods, they are highly impractical. Specifically, LLMZip, a recent text compression system using Llama3-8B requires 9.5 days to compress just 10 MB of text, although with huge improvements in compression ratios. To overcome this, we present FineZip - a novel LLM-based text compression system that combines ideas of online memorization and dynamic context to reduce the compression time immensely. FineZip can compress the above corpus in approximately 4 hours compared to 9.5 days, a 54 times improvement over LLMZip and comparable performance. FineZip outperforms traditional algorithmic compression methods with a large margin, improving compression ratios by approximately 50\\%. With this work, we take the first step towards making lossless text compression with LLMs a reality. While FineZip presents a significant step in that direction, LLMs are still not a viable solution for large-scale text compression.

Motivated by text prompting in LLMs, visual prompting has been explored to enhance LVLMs' capabilities of perceiving visual information. However, previous visual prompting techniques solely process visual inputs without considering text queries, limiting the models' ability to follow text instructions to complete tasks. To fill this gap, in this work, we propose a new prompting technique named Attention Prompting on Image, which just simply overlays a text-query-guided attention heatmap on the original input image and effectively enhances LVLM on various tasks. Specifically, we generate an attention heatmap for the input image dependent on the text query with an auxiliary model like CLIP. Then the heatmap simply multiplies the pixel values of the original image to obtain the actual input image for the LVLM. Extensive experiments on various vison-language benchmarks verify the effectiveness of our technique.

On the other hand, modeling cooperation between multiple agents, specifically, Human-AI Teaming settings while ensuring successful task completion is a challenging problem. To this end, we perform the first investigation of multi-agent PbRL by extending single-agent PbRL to the two-agent teaming settings and formulate it as a Human-AI PbRL Cooperation Game, where the RL agent queries the human-in-the-loop to elicit task objective and human's preferences on the joint team behavior. Under this game formulation, we first introduce the notion of Human Flexibility to evaluate team performance based on if humans prefer to follow a fixed policy or adapt to the RL agent on the fly. Secondly, we study the RL agent's varying access to the human policy. We highlight a special case along these two dimensions, which we call Specified Orchestration, where the human is least flexible and agent has complete access to human policy. We motivate the need for taking Human Flexibility into account and the usefulness of Specified Orchestration through a gamified user study. We evaluate state-of-the-art PbRL algorithms for Human-AI cooperative setups through robot locomotion based domains that explicitly require forced cooperation. Our findings highlight the challenges associated with PbRL by varying Human Flexibility and agent's access to the human policy.

To effectively utilize this data, it is essential to accurately match the geolocation data to the road segments. However, this matching is often not trivial due to the low sampling rate and errors exacerbated by multipath effects in urban environments. Traditionally, statistical modeling techniques such as Hidden-Markov models incorporating domain knowledge into the matching process have been extensively used for map-matching tasks. However, rule-based map-matching tasks are noise-sensitive and inefficient in processing large-scale trajectory data. Deep learning techniques directly learn the relationship between observed data and road networks from the data, often without the need for hand-crafted rules or domain knowledge. This renders them an efficient approach for map-matching large-scale datasets and more robust to the noise. This paper introduces a deep-learning model, specifically the transformer-based encoder-decoder model, to perform as a surrogate for offline map-matching algorithms. The encoder-decoder architecture initially encodes the series of noisy GPS points into a representation that automatically captures autoregressive behavior and spatial correlations between GPS points. Subsequently, the decoder associates data points with the road network features and thus transforms these representations into a sequence of road segments. The model is trained and evaluated using GPS traces collected in Manhattan, New York. Achieving an accuracy of 75%, transformer-based encoder-decoder models extensively employed in natural language processing presented a promising performance for translating noisy GPS data to the navigated routes in urban road networks.",

The second sub-module integrates a deep learning model with a physics-based social force model to progressively predict the complete trajectory using the generated goals.

        "abstract": "arXiv:2211.05207v5 Announce Type: replace-cross Abstract: In intensive care units (ICUs), critically ill patients are monitored with electroencephalograms (EEGs) to prevent serious brain injury. The number of patients who can be monitored is constrained by the availability of trained physicians to read EEGs, and EEG interpretation can be subjective and prone to inter-observer variability. Automated deep learning systems for EEG could reduce human bias and accelerate the diagnostic process. However, black box deep learning models are untrustworthy, difficult to troubleshoot, and lack accountability in real-world applications, leading to a lack of trust and adoption by clinicians. To address these challenges, we propose a novel interpretable deep learning model that not only predicts the presence of harmful brainwave patterns but also provides high-quality case-based explanations of its decisions. Our model performs better than the corresponding black box model, despite being constrained to be interpretable. The learned 2D embedded space provides the first global overview of the structure of ictal-interictal-injury continuum brainwave patterns. The ability to understand how our model arrived at its decisions will not only help clinicians to diagnose and treat harmful brain activities more accurately but also increase their trust and adoption of machine learning models in clinical practice; this could be an integral component of the ICU neurologists' standard workflow.",

Machine unlearning (MU) is the research area that addresses these issues by making a trained AI model forget about undesirable training data. Unfortunately, most existing MU methods incur significant time and computational costs for forgetting. Therefore, it is often difficult to apply these methods to practical datasets and sophisticated architectures, e.g., ImageNet and Transformer. To tackle this problem, we propose a lightweight and effective MU method. Our method identifies the model parameters sensitive to the forgetting targets and adds perturbation to such model parameters. We identify the sensitive parameters by calculating the Fisher Information Matrix (FIM). This approach does not require time-consuming additional training for forgetting. In addition, we introduce class-specific random signals called mnemonic code to reduce the cost of FIM calculation, which generally requires the entire training data and incurs significant computational costs. In our method, we train the model with mnemonic code; when forgetting, we use a small number of mnemonic codes to calculate the FIM and get the effective perturbation for forgetting. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our method is faster and better at forgetting than existing MU methods. Furthermore, we show that our method can scale to more practical datasets and sophisticated architectures.",

The aerial agent needs to not only understand tactically evolving maneuvers of fighter jets from a long-term perspective but also react to rapidly changing aerodynamics of aircraft from a short-term viewpoint. In this paper, we introduce TempFuser, a novel long short-term temporal fusion transformer architecture that can learn agile, tactical, and acrobatic flight maneuvers in complex dogfight problems. Our approach integrates two distinct temporal transition embeddings into a transformer-based network to comprehensively capture both the long-term tactics and short-term agility of aerial agents. By incorporating these perspectives, our policy network generates end-to-end flight commands that secure dominant positions over the long term and effectively outmaneuver agile opponents. After training in a high-fidelity flight simulator, our model successfully learns to execute strategic maneuvers, outperforming baseline policy models against various types of opponent aircraft. Notably, our model exhibits human-like acrobatic maneuvers even when facing adversaries with superior specifications, all without relying on prior knowledge. Moreover, it demonstrates robust pursuit performance in challenging supersonic and low-altitude situations. Demo videos are available at https://sites.google.com/view/tempfuser.",

We then evaluate the quality of ranking outputs introducing the Cognitive Bias Benchmark for LLMs as Evaluators (CoBBLEr), a benchmark to measure six different cognitive biases in LLM evaluation outputs, such as the Egocentric bias where a model prefers to rank its own outputs highly in evaluation. We find that LLMs are biased text quality evaluators, exhibiting strong indications on our bias benchmark (average of 40% of comparisons across all models) within each of their evaluations that question their robustness as evaluators. Furthermore, we examine the correlation between human and machine preferences and calculate the average Rank-Biased Overlap (RBO) score to be 49.6%, indicating that machine preferences are misaligned with humans.

In particular, the synthetic texts generated by LLMs may infringe the IP of the data being used to train the LLMs. To this end, it is imperative to be able to perform source attribution by identifying the data provider who contributed to the generation of a synthetic text by an LLM. In this paper, we show that this problem can be tackled by watermarking, i.e., by enabling an LLM to generate synthetic texts with embedded watermarks that contain information about their source(s). We identify the key properties of such watermarking frameworks (e.g., source attribution accuracy, robustness against adversaries), and propose a source attribution framework that satisfies these key properties due to our algorithmic designs. Our framework enables an LLM to learn an accurate mapping from the generated texts to data providers, which sets the foundation for effective source attribution.

We present a novel polynomial-time algorithm that can find a near-feasible stable matching (adjusting the hospitals' capacities by at most 1) in an HRC instance where the couples' preferences are sub-responsive (i.e., if one member switches to a better hospital, then the couple also improves) and sub-complete (i.e., each pair of hospitals that are individually acceptable to both members are jointly acceptable for the couple) by reducing it to an instance of the Stable Fixtures problem. We also present a polynomial-time algorithm for HRC in a sub-responsive, sub-complete instance that is a Dual Market, or where all couples are one of several possible types. We show that our algorithm also implies the polynomial-time solvability of a stable b-matching problem, where the underlying graph is a multigraph with loops. We complement our algorithms with several hardness results. We show that HRC with sub-responsive and sub-complete couples is NP-hard, even with other strong restrictions. We also show that HRC with a Dual Market is NP-hard under several simultaneous restrictions. Finally, we show that the problem of finding a matching with the minimum number of blocking pairs in HRC is not approximable within $m^{1-\\varepsilon}$, for any $\\varepsilon>0$, where $m$ is the total length of the hospitals' preference lists, unless P=NP, even if each couple applies to only one pair of hospitals.

Therefore, the ability to detect tumors in anomaly scenarios is paramount for ensuring timely interventions and improved patient outcomes. This study addresses the issue by leveraging deep learning (DL) techniques to detect and classify brain tumors in challenging situations. The curated data set from the National Brain Mapping Lab (NBML) comprises 81 patients, including 30 Tumor cases and 51 Normal cases. The detection and classification pipelines are separated into two consecutive tasks. The detection phase involved comprehensive data analysis and pre-processing to modify the number of image samples and the number of patients of each class to anomaly distribution (9 Normal per 1 Tumor) to comply with real world scenarios. Next, in addition to common evaluation metrics for the testing, we employed a novel performance evaluation method called Patient to Patient (PTP), focusing on the realistic evaluation of the model. In the detection phase, we fine-tuned a YOLOv8n detection model to detect the tumor region. Subsequent testing and evaluation yielded competitive performance both in Common Evaluation Metrics and PTP metrics. Furthermore, using the Data Efficient Image Transformer (DeiT) module, we distilled a Vision Transformer (ViT) model from a fine-tuned ResNet152 as a teacher in the classification phase.

Despite the rapid progress in this task, there remain several critical challenges to be solved: (1) Adaptive procedures: Prior works hold an unrealistic assumption that the number of action steps is known and fixed, leading to non-generalizable models in real-world scenarios where the sequence length varies. (2) Temporal relation: Understanding the step temporal relation knowledge is essential in producing reasonable and executable plans. (3) Annotation cost: Annotating instructional videos with step-level labels (i.e., timestamp) or sequence-level labels (i.e., action category) is demanding and labor-intensive, limiting its generalizability to large-scale datasets. In this work, we propose a new and practical setting, called adaptive procedure planning in instructional videos, where the procedure length is not fixed or pre-determined. To address these challenges, we introduce Retrieval-Augmented Planner (RAP) model. Specifically, for adaptive procedures, RAP adaptively determines the conclusion of actions using an auto-regressive model architecture. For temporal relation, RAP establishes an external memory module to explicitly retrieve the most relevant state-action pairs from the training videos and revises the generated procedures. To tackle high annotation cost, RAP utilizes a weakly-supervised learning manner to expand the training dataset to other task-relevant, unannotated videos by generating pseudo labels for action steps. Experiments on CrossTask and COIN benchmarks show the superiority of RAP over traditional fixed-length models, establishing it as a strong baseline solution for adaptive procedure planning.",

The objective function also depends on the realization of stochastic events, and the total number of items we can select over all rounds is bounded by a limited budget. This problem extends, and generalizes to multiple round settings, well-studied problems such as (adaptive) influence maximization and stochastic probing. We show that, if the number of items and stochastic events is somehow bounded, there is a polynomial time dynamic programming algorithm for SBMSm. Then, we provide a simple greedy $1/2(1-1/e-\\epsilon)\\approx 0.316$-approximation algorithm for SBMSm, that first non-adaptively allocates the budget to be spent at each round, and then greedily and adaptively maximizes the objective function by using the budget assigned at each round. Finally, we introduce the {\\em budget-adaptivity gap}, by which we measure how much an adaptive policy for SBMSm is better than an optimal partially adaptive one that, as in our greedy algorithm, determines the budget allocation in advance. We show that the budget-adaptivity gap lies between $e/(e-1)\\approx 1.582$ and $2$.",

        "abstract": "arXiv:2404.16257v2 Announce Type: replace-cross Abstract: Translating major language resources to build minor language resources becomes a widely-used approach. Particularly in translating complex data points composed of multiple components, it is common to translate each component separately. However, we argue that this practice often overlooks the interrelation between components within the same data point. To address this limitation, we propose a novel MT pipeline that considers the intra-data relation in implementing MT for training data. In our MT pipeline, all the components in a data point are concatenated to form a single translation sequence and subsequently reconstructed to the data components after translation. We introduce a Catalyst Statement (CS) to enhance the intra-data relation, and Indicator Token (IT) to assist the decomposition of a translated sequence into its respective data components. Through our approach, we have achieved a considerable improvement in translation quality itself, along with its effectiveness as training data. Compared with the conventional approach that translates each data component separately, our method yields better training data that enhances the performance of the trained model by 2.690 points for the web page ranking (WPR) task, and 0.845 for the question generation (QG) task in the XGLUE benchmark.",

Our work introduces a comprehensive framework to develop a foundation model for general robotic manipulation that formalizes a manipulation task as contact synthesis. Specifically, our model takes as input object and robot manipulator point clouds, object physical attributes, target motions, and manipulation region masks. It outputs contact points on the object and associated contact forces or post-contact motions for robots to achieve the desired manipulation task. We perform extensive experiments both in the simulation and real-world settings, manipulating articulated rigid objects, rigid objects, and deformable objects that vary in dimensionality, ranging from one-dimensional objects like ropes to two-dimensional objects like cloth and extending to three-dimensional objects such as plasticine.

These hallucinations, which arise from fact-conflicting errors when generating code using LLMs, represent a novel form of package confusion attack that poses a critical threat to the integrity of the software supply chain. This paper conducts a rigorous and comprehensive evaluation of package hallucinations across different programming languages, settings, and parameters, exploring how a diverse set of models and configurations affect the likelihood of generating erroneous package recommendations and identifying the root causes of this phenomenon. Using 16 popular LLMs for code generation and two unique prompt datasets, we generate 576,000 code samples in two programming languages that we analyze for package hallucinations. Our findings reveal that that the average percentage of hallucinated packages is at least 5.2% for commercial models and 21.7% for open-source models, including a staggering 205,474 unique examples of hallucinated package names, further underscoring the severity and pervasiveness of this threat. To overcome this problem, we implement several hallucination mitigation strategies and show that they are able to significantly reduce the number of package hallucinations while maintaining code quality. Our experiments and findings highlight package hallucinations as a persistent and systemic phenomenon while using state-of-the-art LLMs for code generation, and a significant challenge which deserves the research community's urgent attention.",

While pioneering approaches utilize PubMed's large-scale, de-identified medical image-text pairs to address these limitations, they still fall short due to inherent data noise. To tackle this, we refined medical image-text pairs from PubMed and employed MLLMs (GPT-4V) in an 'unblinded' capacity to denoise and reformat the data, resulting in the creation of the PubMedVision dataset with 1.3 million medical VQA samples. Our validation demonstrates that: (1) PubMedVision can significantly enhance the medical multimodal capabilities of current MLLMs, showing significant improvement in benchmarks including the MMMU Health & Medicine track; (2) manual checks by medical experts and empirical results validate the superior data quality of our dataset compared to other data construction methods.

This new method takes musical keys into account, recognizing their significant role in shaping music's emotional character through major-minor tonality. It also allows for melodic variation with respect to keys and addresses the problem of data scarcity for better emotion modeling. A Transformer is employed to harmonize key-adaptable melodies, allowing for keys determined in rule-based or model-based manner.

While large vision language representations like CLIP had largely resolved the task of zero-shot object recognition, zero-shot visual attribute recognition remains a challenge because CLIP's contrastively-learned vision-language representation cannot effectively capture object-attribute dependencies. In this paper, we target this weakness and propose a sentence generation-based retrieval formulation for attribute recognition that is novel in 1) explicitly modeling a to-be-measured and retrieved object-attribute relation as a conditional probability graph, which converts the recognition problem into a dependency-sensitive language-modeling problem, and 2) applying a large pretrained Vision-Language Model (VLM) on this reformulation and naturally distilling its knowledge of image-object-attribute relations to use towards attribute recognition. Specifically, for each attribute to be recognized on an image, we measure the visual-conditioned probability of generating a short sentence encoding the attribute's relation to objects on the image. Unlike contrastive retrieval, which measures likelihood by globally aligning elements of the sentence to the image, generative retrieval is sensitive to the order and dependency of objects and attributes in the sentence. We demonstrate through experiments that generative retrieval consistently outperforms contrastive retrieval on two visual reasoning datasets, Visual Attribute in the Wild (VAW), and our newly-proposed Visual Genome Attribute Ranking (VGARank).",

Traditional tools often struggle to efficiently handle the large volume and variety of data generated during DF investigations and Incident Response (IR) processes. This paper introduces a novel framework, GenDFIR, which combines Rule-Based Artificial Intelligence (R-BAI) algorithms with Large Language Models (LLMs) to enhance and automate the TA process. The proposed approach consists of two key stages: (1) R-BAI is used to identify and select anomalous digital artefacts based on predefined rules. (2) The selected artefacts are then transformed into embeddings for processing by an LLM with the assistance of a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) agent. The LLM uses its capabilities to perform automated TA on the artefacts and predict potential incident outcomes. To validate the framework, we evaluated its performance, efficiency, and reliability. Several metrics were applied to simulated cyber incident scenarios, which were presented as forensic case documents. Our findings demonstrate the significant potential of integrating R-BAI and LLMs for TA.

        "abstract": "arXiv:2409.07966v2 Announce Type: replace-cross Abstract: Audio-driven 3D facial animation synthesis has been an active field of research with attention from both academia and industry. While there are promising results in this area, recent approaches largely focus on lip-sync and identity control, neglecting the role of emotions and emotion control in the generative process. That is mainly due to the lack of emotionally rich facial animation data and algorithms that can synthesize speech animations with emotional expressions at the same time. In addition, majority of the models are deterministic, meaning given the same audio input, they produce the same output motion. We argue that emotions and non-determinism are crucial to generate diverse and emotionally-rich facial animations. In this paper, we propose ProbTalk3D a non-deterministic neural network approach for emotion controllable speech-driven 3D facial animation synthesis using a two-stage VQ-VAE model and an emotionally rich facial animation dataset 3DMEAD. We provide an extensive comparative analysis of our model against the recent 3D facial animation synthesis approaches, by evaluating the results objectively, qualitatively, and with a perceptual user study. We highlight several objective metrics that are more suitable for evaluating stochastic outputs and use both in-the-wild and ground truth data for subjective evaluation. To our knowledge, that is the first non-deterministic 3D facial animation synthesis method incorporating a rich emotion dataset and emotion control with emotion labels and intensity levels. Our evaluation demonstrates that the proposed model achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art emotion-controlled, deterministic and non-deterministic models.

        "abstract": "arXiv:2409.10588v4 Announce Type: replace-cross Abstract: Anti-viral therapies are typically designed to target the current strains of a virus. Game theoretically, this corresponds to a short-sighted, or myopic, response. However, therapy-induced selective pressures act on viral antigens to drive the emergence of mutated strains, against which initial therapies have reduced efficacy. Building on a computational model of binding between antibodies and viral antigens (the Absolut! framework), we design and implement a genetic simulation of such viral evolutionary escape. Crucially, this allows our antibody optimisation algorithm to consider and influence the entire escape curve of the virus, i.e. to guide (or ''shape'') the viral evolution. This is inspired by opponent shaping which, in general-sum learning, accounts for the adaptation of the co-player rather than playing a myopic best response. Hence we call the optimised antibodies shapers. Within our simulations, we demonstrate that our shapers target both current and simulated future viral variants, outperforming the antibodies chosen in a myopic way. Furthermore, we show that shapers exert specific evolutionary pressure on the virus compared to myopic antibodies. Altogether, shapers modify the evolutionary trajectories of viral strains and minimise the viral escape compared to their myopic counterparts. While this is a simplified model, we hope that our proposed paradigm will enable the discovery of better long-lived vaccines and antibody therapies in the future, enabled by rapid advancements in the capabilities of simulation tools.

Most research on detecting hallucination focuses on the questions with short and concrete correct answers that are easy to check the faithfulness. Hallucination detections for text generation with open-ended answers are more challenging. Some researchers use external knowledge to detect hallucinations in generated texts, but external resources for specific scenarios are hard to access. Recent studies on detecting hallucinations in long text without external resources conduct consistency comparison among multiple sampled outputs. To handle long texts, researchers split long texts into multiple facts and individually compare the consistency of each pairs of facts. However, these methods (1) hardly achieve alignment among multiple facts; (2) overlook dependencies between multiple contextual facts. In this paper, we propose a graph-based context-aware (GCA) hallucination detection for text generations, which aligns knowledge facts and considers the dependencies between contextual knowledge triples in consistency comparison. Particularly, to align multiple facts, we conduct a triple-oriented response segmentation to extract multiple knowledge triples. To model dependencies among contextual knowledge triple (facts), we construct contextual triple into a graph and enhance triples' interactions via message passing and aggregating via RGCN. To avoid the omission of knowledge triples in long text, we conduct a LLM-based reverse verification via reconstructing the knowledge triples. Experiments show that our model enhances hallucination detection and excels all baselines.",

Thus, strong performance on these benchmarks does not necessarily correlate with strong visual understanding. In this paper, we release JourneyBench, a comprehensive human-annotated benchmark of generated images designed to assess the model's fine-grained multimodal reasoning abilities across five tasks: complementary multimodal chain of thought, multi-image VQA, imaginary image captioning, VQA with hallucination triggers, and fine-grained retrieval with sample-specific distractors. Unlike existing benchmarks, JourneyBench explicitly requires fine-grained multimodal reasoning in unusual imaginary scenarios where language bias and holistic image gist are insufficient. We benchmark state-of-the-art models on JourneyBench and analyze performance along a number of fine-grained dimensions. Results across all five tasks show that JourneyBench is exceptionally challenging for even the best models, indicating that models' visual reasoning abilities are not as strong as they first appear.

One of the common approaches empowered by deep learning is Physics-informed Neural Networks (PINNs). Recently, a new type of fundamental neural network model, Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs), has been proposed as a substitute of Multilayer Perceptions (MLPs), and possesses trainable activation functions. To enhance KANs in fitting accuracy, a modification of KANs, so called ReLU-KANs, using \"square of ReLU\" as the basis of its activation functions, has been suggested. In this work, we propose another basis of activation functions, namely, Higherorder-ReLU (HR), which is simpler than the basis of activation functions used in KANs, namely, Bsplines; allows efficient KAN matrix operations; and possesses smooth and non-zero higher-order derivatives, essential to physicsinformed neural networks. We name such KANs with Higher-order-ReLU (HR) as their activations, HRKANs. Our detailed experiments on two famous and representative PDEs, namely, the linear Poisson equation and nonlinear Burgers' equation with viscosity, reveal that our proposed Higher-order-ReLU-KANs (HRKANs) achieve the highest fitting accuracy and training robustness and lowest training time significantly among KANs, ReLU-KANs and HRKANs.

Quantization is a promising way to compress and accelerate models. Nevertheless, due to the wide range and time-varying activations in diffusion models, existing methods cannot maintain both accuracy and efficiency simultaneously for low-bit quantization. To tackle this issue, we propose DilateQuant, a novel quantization framework for diffusion models that offers comparable accuracy and high efficiency. Specifically, we keenly aware of numerous unsaturated in-channel weights, which can be cleverly exploited to reduce the range of activations without additional computation cost. Based on this insight, we propose Weight Dilation (WD) that maximally dilates the unsaturated in-channel weights to a constrained range through a mathematically equivalent scaling. WD costlessly absorbs the activation quantization errors into weight quantization. The range of activations decreases, which makes activations quantization easy. The range of weights remains constant, which makes model easy to converge in training stage. Considering the temporal network leads to time-varying activations, we design a Temporal Parallel Quantizer (TPQ), which sets time-step quantization parameters and supports parallel quantization for different time steps, significantly improving the performance and reducing time cost. To further enhance performance while preserving efficiency, we introduce a Block-wise Knowledge Distillation (BKD) to align the quantized models with the full-precision models at a block level. The simultaneous training of time-step quantization parameters and weights minimizes the time required, and the shorter backpropagation paths decreases the memory footprint of the quantization process.",

Second, to what extent does varying the sparsity or the size of the SAE affect monosemanticity / interpretability? By investigating these questions in the context of a simple first-letter identification task where we have complete access to ground truth labels for all tokens in the vocabulary, we are able to provide more detail than prior investigations. Critically, we identify a problematic form of feature-splitting we call feature absorption where seemingly monosemantic latents fail to fire in cases where they clearly should.

Each robot executor selects a feasible action to implement the assigned subtask and reports self-reflection feedback to the task assigner for plan adjustment. The PEFA loops until the task is completed. Moreover, we create a challenging heterogeneous multi-robot task planning benchmark encompassing 100 complex long-horizon tasks.

Unlike existing works that encodes the whole context, its main idea lies in dividing the retrieved documents into blocks, where each block calculates key-value (KV) states independently except for the final block. In RAG scenarios, by defining each passage as a block, Block-Attention enables us to pre-compute the KV states for all passages and cache them in memory, significantly reducing the latency and the computation cost during inference. The implementation involves block segmentation, positional encoding calculation, and fine-tuning the LLM to adapt to the Block-Attention mechanism.

While these models have also been applied in healthcare, most of them only predict one value at a time, which is unrealistic in a clinical setting where multiple measures are taken at once. In this work, we extend the framework temporal fusion transformer (TFT), a multi-horizon time series prediction tool, and propose TFT-multi, an end-to-end framework that can predict multiple vital trajectories simultaneously. We apply TFT-multi to forecast 5 vital signs recorded in the intensive care unit: blood pressure, pulse, SpO2, temperature and respiratory rate. We hypothesize that by jointly predicting these measures, which are often correlated with one another, we can make more accurate predictions, especially in variables with large missingness. We validate our model on the public MIMIC dataset and an independent institutional dataset, and demonstrate that this approach outperforms state-of-the-art univariate prediction tools including the original TFT and Prophet, as well as vector regression modeling for multivariate prediction.

        "abstract": "arXiv:2409.15955v2 Announce Type: replace-cross Abstract: Federated learning is a distributed learning framework which enables clients to train models individually and to upload their model updates for aggregation. The local training process heavily relies on distributed gradient descent techniques. In the situation where gradient information is not available, the gradients need to be estimated from zeroth-order information, which typically involves computing finite-differences along isotropic random directions. This method suffers from high estimation errors, as the geometric features of the objective landscape may be overlooked during the isotropic sampling. In this work, we propose a non-isotropic sampling method to improve the gradient estimation procedure. Gradients in our method are estimated in a subspace spanned by historical trajectories of solutions, aiming to encourage the exploration of promising regions and hence improve the convergence. We implement this method in zeroth-order federated settings, and show that the convergence rate aligns with existing ones while introducing no significant overheads in communication or local computation. The effectiveness of our proposal is verified on several numerical experiments in comparison to several commonly-used zeroth-order federated optimization algorithms.",

        "abstract": "Arginine (R) methylation, catalyzed by PROTEIN ARGININE METHYLTRANSFERASES (PRMTs), is critical for regulation of gene expression at the transcriptional and post-transcriptional level. Among nine PRMT genes in Arabidopsis, PRMT5 catalyzing symmetric R dimethylation of its targets is best characterized. PRMT5 mutants are late flowering and show altered responses to environmental stress. Among PRMT5 targets are Arabidopsis thaliana GLYCINE RICH RNA BINDING PROTEIN 7 (AtGRP7) and AtGRP8 that promote the transition to flowering. AtGRP7 R141 has been shown to be modified by PRMT5. Here, we tested whether this symmetric dimethylation of R141 is important for the physiological role of AtGRP7 in flowering time control. We constructed AtGRP7 mutant variants with non-methylable R141 (R141A, R141K). Genomic clones containing these variants complemented the late flowering phenotype of the grp7-1 mutant to the same extend as wild-type AtGRP7. Furthermore, overexpression of AtGRP7 R141A or R141K promoted flowering similar to overexpression of the wild-type protein. Thus, flowering time does not depend on R141 and its modification. However, AtGRP7 R141 contributes to the activity of GRP7 in response to abscisic. Immunopre-cipitation of AtGRP7-GFP in the prmt5 background revealed that antibodies against dimethylated arginine still recognized AtGRP7, suggesting that additional methyltransferases may be responsible for modification of AtGRP7.",

Such seeds are albuminous with a persistent copious living endosperm that accumulates galactomannans. However, our understanding of the regulation of endosperm maturation, cell wall formation and galactomannan biosynthesis in albuminous seeds remains very limited. To gain insights into these processes, a large RNA-seq dataset was produced (14 coffee species x 5 endosperm developmental stages) and scrutinized using gene coexpression network analysis. The network revealed tight transcriptional coordination of the core galactomannan biosynthetic machinery for sucrose import, glycolysis, nucleotide sugar synthesis and transport, arabinogalactan protein and cellulose synthesis, and regulation of the trans-Golgi network. The orchestration of galactomannan and oil accumulation during endosperm maturation appeared to be exerted by the transcription factors FUSCA3, WRINKLED1, SHINE2 and DREB2D. The latter was the only coexpression partner of galactomannan biosynthetic genes. Numerous key genes of galactomannan biosynthesis were significantly upregulated in coffee somatic embryos overexpressing DREB2D, which showed increased production of UDP-galactose and diversion towards raffinose family oligosaccharides. Further, most genes of the galactomannan coexpression module were identified as DREB2D target genes by DAP-seq analysis.",

Metabolic pathway kinases (VIP1/VIHs) leading to the production of PP-InsPs are now well characterized in yeast and plants. Previously, the wheat inositol pyrophosphate kinase (TaVIH2) was shown to encode a catalytic active kinase domain. Heterologous expression of TaVIH2 in Arabidopsis thaliana showed enhanced drought tolerance by modulating the cell composition. In this study, we attempted to identify the interacting protein targets of wheat VIH2-3B using a yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) cDNA library screen, identifying 52 putative interactors that are primarily involved in cell wall-related functions. Notably, fasciclin-like arabinogalactan protein (FLA7), a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored protein emerged as the most frequently interacting partner in the screen. Further analysis using pull-down assays validated the interaction between TaVIH2-3B and TaFLA7 in vivo. Using the reporter fusion studies, we observed the localization of TaFLA7 to be a plasma membrane. We also observed that this localization of the FLA7 was perturbed in the yeast vip1delta strain. The expression of TaVIH2-3B bearing PP-InsP5K enzymatic activity in yeast mutants rescued the localisation of the FLA7 to the membrane. Expression analysis of TaFLA7 showed differential expression response under drought in wheat shoot tissues. TaFLA7 was also found to be highly expressed during grain development, particularly in the endosperm and seed coat during grain maturation. Taken together, these findings highlight the potential role of TaVIH2 in cell wall remodelling and stress response pathways, offering new insights into the functional roles of VIH proteins in plants.",

If the microbial partner does not reciprocate with a comparable symbiotic benefit, the interaction represents a parasitic relationship. This is thought to elicit a plant's response to prevent the selective disadvantage of being parasitized by such microbial cheaters. Indeed, negative feedback against bad mutualists, known as sanctioning, has been observed in interactions such as the arbuscular mycorrhizal and legume-rhizobium symbioses. Here, to study sanctioning by the plant host, we manipulate the exchange of resources between the model legume Medicago truncatula and its bacterial partner Sinorhizobium meliloti by three ways: mutating the bacterial nitrogenase enzyme, replacing nitrogen in the atmosphere with argon gas, and supplying high nitrate to the host. Then, we follow the consequences for the interaction by examining the metabolome, proteome, and phosphoproteome of nodules. We find that such cheating conditions result in sanctioning of the bacterial partner, and observe characteristic shifts including induced defense markers, repressed symbiotic markers, and changes in central metabolism that may be relevant for microbial fitness and that could therefore contribute to sanctioning.",

We also identified a chromosomal translocation between chromosomes 5 and 32, as well as evidence of pairing exclusively within subgenomes, except for a homoeologous exchange in chromosome 21.

        "abstract": "Root systems take up water and nutrients from the soil and thereby underpin all essential plant functions. The size of the root system affects the ability of roots to capture these resources and determine the amount of carbon that roots transfer into the soil. Understanding the genetic basis of root biomass is therefore very important for enhancing crop resilience and productivity, especially in the face of climate change, as for soil carbon sequestration efforts. In our study, we catalogued root biomass of a diverse set of Arabidopsis accessions mainly derived from Sweden and Spain and utilized GWAS to identify loci associated with root biomass in Arabidopsis thaliana. We found that genetic variants associated with high biomass are enriched in accessions originating from distinct biogeographic regions in Spain. Among the most significant SNPs, one SNP on chromosome 3, was closely linked to three genes for which loss of function mutations caused significant increases in root, shoot and seed biomass and that we named GROOT genes. These genes act as general growth limiters. Additionally, our analysis revealed that the GROOT genes are in strong linkage disequilibrium, implying a potential coordinated function in regulating growth. Furthermore, accessions carrying the non-reference allele at this SNP showed markedly higher biomass under elevated temperatures, suggesting that these genes may also play a role in temperature adaptation. The discovery that the GROOT genes can enhance biomass without negative trade-offs across multiple traits opens new avenues for further research aimed at understanding genetically determined growth limitations, and for improving crop resilience and adaptability, as well as carbon sequestration.",

Fluctuating temperatures can also influence the patterns of cytosine DNA methylation, thereby influencing gene expression. However, whether these epigenetic changes provide an adaptative advantage remains unclear. Here, we provide evidence that DNA methylation is required to regulate thermomorphogenesis. Hypomethylated drm1 drm2 cmt3 mutants or seedlings treated with 5-azacytidine to block DNA methylation exhibit reduced hypocotyl growth at warm temperatures, primarily due to impaired cell elongation. Moreover, DNA hypomethylation compromises auxin biosynthesis and transport in response to warmth, partially by reducing PIF4 protein levels. Notably, the loss of DNA methylation leads to increased expression of SUPPRESSOR OF drm1 drm2 cmt3 (SDC), which in turn restricts hypocotyl elongation during thermomorphogenesis. Finally, we demonstrate that DNAme regulates the inhibition of SDC expression to promote gibberellin biosynthesis. Our findings underscore the critical role of DNA methylation in modulating gene expression in response to temperature fluctuations and provide new insights into the epigenetic regulation of thermomorphogenesis.",

Accordingly, defense genes were induced with different expression kinetics, including those promoting lignification, terpene biosynthesis, and oxidative stress. Crosstalk between stress hormone pathways also occurred, notably leading to the repression of jasmonic acid biosynthesis genes after agroinfiltration, and dampening of salicylic acid-inducible responses upon S protein accumulation. Overall, influenza VLP- and CoVLP-induced responses broadly overlapped, suggesting nanoparticle production to have the most effects on plant immunity, regardless of the virus surface proteins expressed.

CoVLP production also upregulated asparagine synthetase genes and led to consequent accumulation of asparagine, a nitrogen-rich amino acid is known to facilitate the reallocation of nitrogen resources from senescent to young growing organs. Hypothesizing these combined host responses to restrain foreign protein accumulation, an attempt was made to support nitrogen reduction in CoVLP-producing leaves by co-expressing a constitutively active, light-insensitive form of the nitrate reductase.

Despite the importance of alternative and noncoding transcripts for enabling plant life, their accurate quantification causes major challenges as many of them are expressed at low levels and tissue-specific.

Coordinate regulation of the tetrapyrrole pathway was observed as transcriptional feedback regulation of genes in the tetrapyrrole pathway in Oy1-N1898/+ mutants. Natural variation in the wild-type allele at oy1 modulated the severity of the impact of Oy1-N1989/+ on gene expression. We also studied the effects of previously identified cis-acting expression variation at oy1 in wild-type plants. The seventy transcripts encoding biosynthetic enzymes in the tetrapyrrole pathway exhibited similar transcriptional co-regulation in response to cis-variation in oy1 transcript accumulation in wild-type plants as observed in the RNAseq of Oy1-N1989/+ mutants. This demonstrated that the coordinate regulation of the pathway also occurs during physiologically-relevant variation in OY1 abundance. Cis variants at seven tetrapyrrole pathway genes were linked to variation in chlorophyll accumulation in Oy1-N1989/+ mutant or wild-type plants. Analysis of trans-acting transcriptional variation by eGWAS detected multiple transcriptional hotspots, which disproportionately affected the expression of a subset of tetrapyrrole pathway genes, indicating that some genes are repeated targets of transcriptional regulation. The trans-regulatory hotspots coordinately regulated this pathway and may work to limit the accumulation of phototoxic intermediates.",

        "abstract": "Insect and pathogen outbreaks have a major impact on northern forest ecosystems. Even for pathogens that have been present in a region for decades, such as beech bark disease (BBD), new waves of mortality are expected in host populations. Hence, there is a need for innovative approaches to monitor their advancement extensively in real-time. Here we test whether airborne hyperspectral imaging, involving data from 344 wavelengths in the visible, near infrared (NIR) and short-wave infrared (SWIR), can be used to assess beech bark disease severity in southern Quebec, Canada. Field data on disease severity were linked to the airborne hyperspectral data for individual beech crowns. Partial least-squares regression (PLSR) models using airborne imaging spectroscopy data predicted a small proportion of the variance in beech bark disease severity: the best model had an R2 of only 0.10. Wavelengths with the strongest contributions were from the NIR (~719 nm) and the SWIR (~1287 nm), which may suggest mediation by canopy greenness, water content and canopy architecture. Similar models using hyperspectral data taken directly on individual leaves had no explanatory power (R2 = 0). In addition, airborne and leaf-level hyperspectral datasets were uncorrelated. The failure of leaf-level models suggests that canopy structure was likely responsible for the limited predictive ability of the airborne model. Somewhat better performance in predicting disease severity was found using common band ratios for canopy greenness assessment (the Green Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, gNDVI, the Red-edge Inflexion Point, REIP, and the Normalized Phaeophytinization Index, NPQI); these variables explained up to 19% of the variation in disease severity. Overall, we argue that the complexity of hyperspectral data is not necessary for assessing BBD spread and that spectral data in general may not provide an efficient means of improving BBD monitoring on a larger scale.",

The whitefly-transmitted Tomato yellow leaf curl virus (TYLCV) poses a significant threat to its cultivation. The management strategies for this disease include controlling the virus and/or the vector. The multi-disease and insect-resistant lines developed by the World Vegetable Centre (WorldVeg) contain Ty-1/Ty-3 genes for virus resistance and WF2-10 and WF3-09 genes for whitefly resistance. This study evaluates the efficacy of suppressing virus accumulation in multi-disease and insect-resistant tomato lines compared to Ty-resistant or whitefly-resistant lines and a susceptible check. Preference bioassays, controlled inoculation with viruliferous whiteflies, and acylsugar quantification revealed that multi-disease and insect-resistant lines, developed at WorldVeg, had significantly higher acylsugar concentration and were less preferred by the whitefly adults for settling and whiteflies had high adult mortality. The multi-disease and insect-resistant lines also showed less severe disease symptoms and reduced virus accumulation over time when compared to Ty-resistant, whitefly-resistant, and susceptible check. The findings reveal that the multi-disease and insect-resistant lines are superior in mitigating the threat posed by TYLCV compared to TYLCV-resistant lines. These results underscore the potential of combined virus and vector resistance in tomatoes as a key element of Integrated Pest Management strategies against whitefly-transmitted TYLCV, offering a sustainable solution for safeguarding tomato production.",

CLAVATA signaling consists of mobile, cell-type or environment-specific CLAVATA3/ESR-related (CLE) peptides, which are perceived by a receptor complex consisting of leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinases such as CLAVATA1 and receptor-like proteins such as CLAVATA2, which often functions with the pseudokinase CORYNE (CRN). CLAVATA signaling has been extensively studied in various plant species for its role in meristem maintenance and in legumes for modulating root interactions with nitrogen-fixing rhizobia. Some signaling proteins involved in development and nodulation, including CLAVATA1, also regulate plant interactions with mutualistic arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi. However, our knowledge on AM symbiosis regulation by CLAVATA signaling remains limited and only a handful of genetic regulators have been identified. Here we report that Medicago truncatula CRN controls inflorescence meristem branching and negatively regulates root interactions with AM fungi. MtCRN functions partially independently of the AM autoregulation signal MtCLE53. Transcriptomic data revealed that crn roots display signs of perturbed signaling related to a range of responses to biotic and abiotic factors, suggesting that MtCRN plays various roles in plant development and interactions with the environment.",

This study investigates the effects of three Group 15 pre-emergent herbicides (Flufenacet, S-ethyl dipropylthiocarbamate (EPTC), and tri-allate) on two well-characterized blackgrass (Alopecurus myosuroides) biotypes. Blackgrass is the predominant weed threatening winter wheat production in North-West Europe and the effective use of pre-emergent herbicides is important for preventing otherwise difficult-to-control blackgrass from establishing in agricultural fields. Using a sterile, agar-based system, we quantified the effects of multiple doses of flufenacet, EPTC, or tri-allate on plant physiology, including germination and early seedling growth, as well as the effects of a single dose on key biochemical pathways, specifically cuticular wax composition and fatty acid metabolism in biotypes exhibiting either non-target site herbicide resistance or complete sensitivity to all tested herbicides. Our data demonstrate that the three Group 15 pre-emergent herbicides alter cuticular wax composition and fatty acid profiles differently and that the resistant and herbicide-naive biotypes show distinct responses to each herbicide. The GC-FID and GC-MS data from the different Group 15 pre-emergent herbicides are consistent with the observed differences in physiology and identify potential differences in how and where these herbicides act in these biotypes.

        "abstract": "Dynamic control of signaling events requires swift regulation of receptors at an active state. By focusing on Arabidopsis ERECTA (ER) receptor kinase, which perceives peptide ligands to control multiple developmental processes, we report a mechanism preventing inappropriate receptor activity. The ER C-terminal tail (ER_CT) functions as an autoinhibitory domain: its removal confers higher kinase activity and hyperactivity during inflorescence and stomatal development. ER_CT is required for the binding of a receptor kinase inhibitor, BKI1, and two U-box E3 ligases PUB30 and PUB31 that inactivate activated ER. We further identify ER_CT as a phosphodomain trans-phosphorylated by the co-receptor BAK1. The phosphorylation impacts the tail structure, likely releasing from autoinhibition. The phosphonull version enhances BKI1 association, whereas the phosphomimetic version promotes PUB30/31 association. Thus, ER_CT acts as an off-on-off toggle switch, facilitating the release of BKI1 inhibition, enabling signal activation, and swiftly turning over the receptors afterwards. Our results elucidate a mechanism fine-tuning receptor signaling via a phosphoswitch module, keeping the receptor at a low basal state and ensuring the robust yet transient activation upon ligand perception. SignificanceCells perceive and process external signals through their cell-surface receptors, whose activity must be tightly maintained to prevent the spread of misinformation. How do plant cells prevent the inappropriate receptor activity? We identify a structural module within the C-terminal tail of the ERECTA (ER_CT), that inhibits the receptor pre- and post-signal activation. The ER_CT comprises of a linker and an -helix. Before activation, ER_CT is autoinhibitory and associates with an inhibitory protein. Ligand perception triggers the transphosphorylation of ER_CT by the co-receptor, which then recruits a degradation machinery to swiftly turn over the activated receptor. Thus, we reveal an off-on-off toggle switch mechanism that finely adjusts the activity of the plant receptor, enabling the precise control over cell signaling.",

        "abstract": "Micropropagation systems have been developed for photoperiod sensitive cultivars of cannabis, but there are currently no published methods for day-neutral genotypes. Most established cannabis micropropagation systems rely on shoot proliferation using modal explants that need them to be maintained in vegetative growth, which is not possible for day-neutral genotypes. Floral reversion, the process by which plants revert to vegetative growth from the generative stage, has been demonstrated as an alternative and potentially more efficient approach to the micropropagation of photoperiodic cannabis. The current study investigated if this process could be adapted to facilitate the micropropagation of day-neutral genotypes and overcome existing barriers. During the process, various factors such as photoperiod and light intensity may influence the efficiency of floral reversion. To evaluate this approach in day-neutral cultivars, various photoperiods were compared to assess the impact on reversion rate and subsequent growth. Excised florets obtained from in vitro day-neutral C. sativa cv. \"Blue Auto Mazar x auto Blueberry\" seedlings were subjected to five photoperiods including 12.0, 16.0, 18.0, 20.0, and 24.0 hours of light per day for four weeks. Reversion rates and time, shoot length, shoot number, and node number were measured. Statistical analyses revealed significant differences (p-values < 0.05) in terms of reversion time among photoperiod treatments. The highest reversion rate happened under the 16.0 hr photoperiod with 72% success. The highest shoot lengths were observed under 20.0 hr of photoperiods with a mean of 10.1 mm and the lowest shoot length belonged to 12.0 hr of photoperiods with a mean of 5.6 mm, respectively. Reverted shoots developed vegetatively for some time before initiating new flowers. However, during this period the shoots were successfully rooted in vitro and then acclimated to the growth chamber where they completed their life cycle, including seed production. This process was also successfully achieved from a 2-year old culture of C. sativa cv. \"Blue Auto Mazar\", demonstrating that it is feasible to use this approach for long term culture maintenance and multiplication. This study demonstrates that floral reversion can successfully be used to clonally propagate day-neutral cannabis plants and serves as a basis for developing large-scale clonal propagation and breeding strategies.",

Here we identify Arabidopsis thaliana DPH2 and show that it is required for diphthamide biosynthesis, localizes to the cytosol and interacts physically with AtDPH1. Arabidopsis dph2 mutants form shorter primary roots and smaller rosettes than the wild type, similar to dph1 mutants which we characterized previously. Additionally, increased ribosomal -1 frameshifting error rates and attenuated TARGET OF RAPAMYCIN (TOR) kinase activity in dph2 mutants also phenocopy the dph1 mutant. Beyond the known heavy-metal hypersensitivity and heat shock tolerance of dph1, we newly show here that both dph1 and dph2 mutants are hypersensitive to elevated light intensities and oxidative stress, and that wild-type Arabidopsis seedlings accumulate diphthamide-unmodified eEF2 under oxidative stress. Both mutants share the deregulation of 1,186 transcripts in numerous environmental and hormone responses. AtDPH1 and AtDPH2 do not complement the corresponding mutants of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In summary, DPH2 and DPH1 interact to function inter-dependently in diphthamide formation, the maintenance of translational fidelity, wild-type growth rates and TOR kinase activation, and they contribute to mitigating damage from elevated light intensities and oxidative stress.

Growing clubroot-resistant cultivars remains the most effective and practical approach to managing clubroot disease.

In this study, we identified PMR4 as a potential gene target for creating a novel clubroot-resistant source. Recessive PMR4 mutations in Arabidopsis thaliana conferred broad-spectrum resistance to multiple P. brassicae pathotypes, independent of salicylic acid-mediated plant immunity. CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene-editing was employed to create mutations in two PMR4 orthologs in the B. napus genome, and resulting homozygous mutants exhibited dual resistance to powdery mildew and clubroot. PMR4 is required for the callose deposition at wound and powdery mildew infection sites in leaves. This study reveals that callose deposition in roots is induced by P. brassicae infection and requires PMR4. It appears that the clubroot disease progression is arrested at the primary-to-secondary infection phase in pmr4-1 mutants. Together, this study demonstrates that PMR4-encoded callose synthase is a host susceptibility factor required for P. brassicae to complete its life cycle, and that PMR4 can be targeted against both powdery mildew and clubroot diseases in Brassica crops.",

Understanding the molecular interactions mediating these host-pathogen interactions in effector-triggered immunity is thus essential to managing fungal disease. In silico methods of predicting interspecies PPIs have been heavily studied to identify target genes for crop resistance. But conventional sequence-based homology methods (i.e., interlog, domain-based inference) for predicting interspecies PPIs are not as powerful as methods that also incorporate structural homology. The objective of this study was to develop a computational workflow to predict PPIs between pathogenic fungi and their cereal hosts by leveraging recent advances in artificial intelligence and structural biology. This workflow proposes the use of a generative model, RFdiffusion, to predict the structure of truncated segments of proteins likely to bind to query effector proteins. The binder structures were filtered based on the number of contacts at the effectors known binding residues. Acceptable structures were then input into FoldSeek to search the host proteome for host proteins containing similar sub-structures. Experimentally-validated PPIs between rice (Oryzae sativa cv. Japonica) and rice blast fungus (Magnaporthe oryzae) were used for workflow validation. The effects of binder length and the binding residues mode of action (i.e., residues at active/substrate recognition sites) on the binder quality and presumptive host protein matches were explored. Ultimately, 11 out of 14 experimentally validated PPIs were recovered computationally, indicating a high recall (>78%) for the workflow. The shorter binders recovered most of the PPIs, but may have produced the most false positives, as functional analyses revealed that these host proteins displayed a wide variety of functions. These findings emphasize that subject matter expertise is still required to decipher the prediction results. Yet, this framework for elucidating interactions between fungal pathogens and host proteins could provide valuable insight into mechanisms of susceptibility or resistance at a scale friendly to limited computational resources, and facilitate the development of control strategies that reduce crop diseases.",

However, the efficacy of biocontrol strategies is often limited by a lack of resilience under varying environmental conditions and interactions with native microbial communities in the field. In this study, we assembled a bacterial wilt-suppressive synthetic community (SynCom) in tomato, consisting of bacterial isolates derived from co-cultured microbial complexes associated with the plant. This SynCom demonstrates significant disease-suppressive effects against Ralstonia solanacearum in tomato seedlings under both axenic and soil conditions. Additionally, our findings suggest the existence of an optimal level of SynCom colonization in plants, which is critical for effective disease control. Furthermore, the SynCom exhibits direct antibiotic activity and immunogenic properties that enhance the production of defense-related secondary metabolites, thereby influencing the plant-associated microbiome. Our results provide an effective approach to constructing SynComs that exert disease-suppressive effects within microbial community contexts.",

        "abstract": "Although Rubisco is the most abundant enzyme globally, it is inefficient for carbon fixation because of its low turnover rate and limited ability to distinguish CO2 and O2, especially under high O2 conditions. To address these limitations, phytoplankton, including cyanobacteria and algae, have evolved CO2-concentrating mechanisms (CCM) that involve compartmentalizing Rubisco within specific structures, such as carboxysomes in cyanobacteria or pyrenoids in algae. Engineering plant chloroplasts to establish similar structures for compartmentalizing Rubisco has attracted increasing interest for improving photosynthesis and carbon assimilation in crop plants. Here, we present a method to effectively induce the condensation of endogenous Rubisco within tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) chloroplasts by genetically fusing superfolder green fluorescent protein (sfGFP) to the tobacco Rubisco large subunit (RbcL). By leveraging the intrinsic oligomerization feature of sfGFP, we successfully created pyrenoid-like Rubisco condensates that display dynamic, liquid-like properties within chloroplasts without affecting Rubisco assembly and catalytic function. The transgenic tobacco plants demonstrated comparable autotrophic growth rates and full life cycles in ambient air relative to the wild-type plants. Our study offers a promising strategy for modulating endogenous Rubisco assembly and spatial organization in plant chloroplasts via phase separation, which provides the foundation for generating synthetic organelle-like structures for carbon fixation, such as carboxysomes and pyrenoids, to optimize photosynthetic efficiency.",

When the topic is approached from a macroeconomic perspective, the most frequent has been the examination of the effects of uncertainty shocks on short-term dynamics with various methods, but mainly with neo-Keynesian and statistical (vector autoregressive) models. This document responds to another concern and has two objectives: 1. to reflect on this issue with some instruments of the macroeconomist's toolbox related to a medium or long-term horizon, and 2. report a ciphering of the social cost of uncertainty in the Colombian case.",

We investigate the effect of the purchase of cloud services on the long run size growth rate of French firms. Our findings suggest that cloud services positively impact firm growth rates, with smaller firms experiencing more significant benefits compared to larger firms. This evidence suggests that the diffusion of cloud technologies may help mitigate concentration in the era of the digital transition by favouring the digitalisation and growth of smaller firms, especially when the cloud services provided are more advanced.",

We characterize sorting, wages, and comparative statics and show these substantively differ from traditional assignment models. Under composite sorting: (1) distinct worker types work in the same occupation, and (2) a worker type is simultaneously part of both positive and negative sorting. Quantitatively, our model can generate sizable earnings dispersion and the decomposition of earnings dispersion between and within occupations, as well as their changes over time.",

        "abstract": "arXiv:2404.11334v2 Announce Type: replace Abstract: Diversity in leadership positions, including corporate boards, is an important aspect of equality. It is important because it is the key to better decision-making and innovation, and above all, it paves the way for future generations to participate and shape our society. Many studies emphasize the importance of the visibility of role models and the effect that connectivity has on the success of minorities in leadership. However, the connectivity of firms, the dynamics of the adoption of minorities into leadership positions, and the long-term effects in terms of group dynamics and visibility are not well understood. Here, we present a model that shows how these effects work together in a dynamic model that is calibrated with empirical data of firm and board networks. We show that homophily -- the appointment of minorities is influenced by the presence of minorities in a board and its neighboring entities -- is an important effect shaping the trajectory towards equality. We further show how perception biases and feedback related to the visibility of minority members influence the dynamic. We find that reaching equality can be sped up or slowed down depending on the distribution of minorities in central firms. These insights bear significant implications for policy-making geared towards fostering equality and diversity within corporate boards.",

In such settings, randomization of the treatment may result in treated and control groups with very different characteristics at baseline, inducing biases. We propose a variety of experimental non-randomized synthetic control designs (Abadie, Diamond and Hainmueller, 2010, Abadie and Gardeazabal, 2003) that select the units to be treated, as well as the untreated units to be used as a control group. Average potential outcomes are estimated as weighted averages of the outcomes of treated units for potential outcomes with treatment, and weighted averages the outcomes of control units for potential outcomes without treatment. We analyze the properties of estimators based on synthetic control designs and propose new inferential techniques. We show that in experimental settings with aggregate units, synthetic control designs can substantially reduce estimation biases in comparison to randomization of the treatment.",

In our model, a principal hires a risk-averse agent to carry out a project. Specifically, the agent can perform two different tasks, namely to increase the instantaneous growth rate of the project's value, and to reduce the likelihood of accidents occurring. In order to compensate for these costly actions, the principal offers a continuous stream of payments throughout the entire duration of a contract, which concludes at a random time, potentially resulting in a lump-sum payment. We examine the consequences stemming from the introduction of accidents, modelled by a compound Poisson process that negatively impact the project's value. Furthermore, we investigate whether certain economic scenarii are still characterised by a golden parachute as in Sannikov's model. A golden parachute refers to a situation where the agent stops working and subsequently receives a compensation, which may be either a lump-sum payment leading to termination of the contract or a continuous stream of payments, thereby corresponding to a pension.",
