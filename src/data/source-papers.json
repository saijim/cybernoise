We investigate, on a large selection of 12 motor-imagery datasets, which ones are well suited for transfer, both as donors and as receivers. Challenges. Deep learning models typically require long training times and are data-hungry, which impedes their use for BCI systems that have to minimize the recording time for (training) examples and are subject to constraints induced by experiments involving human subjects. A solution to both issues is transfer learning, but it comes with its own challenge, i.e., substantial data distribution shifts between datasets, subjects and even between subsequent sessions of the same subject. Approach. For every pair of pre-training (donor) and test (receiver) dataset, we first train a model on the donor before training merely an additional new linear classification layer based on a few receiver trials. Performance of this transfer approach is then tested on other trials of the receiver dataset. Significance. First, we lower the threshold to use transfer learning between motor imagery datasets: the overall framework is extremely simple and nevertheless obtains decent classification scores. Second, we demonstrate that deep learning models are a good option for motor imagery cross-dataset transfer both for the reasons outlined in the first point and because the framework presented is viable in online scenarios. Finally, analysing which datasets are best suited for transfer learning can be used as a reference for future researchers to determine which to use for pre-training or benchmarking.","creator":"Pierre Guetschel, Michael Tangermann"},{"id":"2311.16111","slug":"deep-explainability-spin-geometrical-neural-meta-structures-arxiv-2311-16111v1-q-bio-nc","title":"Deep Explainability: Spin-Geometrical Neural Meta-Structures.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16111","abstract":"We face up to the challenge of explainability in multimodal artificial intelligence.

In this paper, we demonstrate that data processing with spiking neurons can be enhanced by co-learning the connection weights with two other biologically inspired neuronal features: 1) a set of parameters describing neuronal adaptation processes and 2) synaptic propagation delays. The former allows the spiking neuron to learn how to specifically react to incoming spikes based on its past. The trained adaptation parameters result in neuronal heterogeneity, which is found in the brain and also leads to a greater variety in available spike patterns. The latter enables to learn to explicitly correlate patterns that are temporally distanced. Synaptic delays reflect the time an action potential requires to travel from one neuron to another. We show that each of the co-learned features separately leads to an improvement over the baseline SNN and that the combination of both leads to state-of-the-art SNN results on all speech recognition datasets investigated with a simple 2-hidden layer feed-forward network.

Traditional methods often discard missing data or replace it with a zero vector, neglecting the availability issue of noisy data. Consequently, these approaches are not fully applicable to realistic scenarios, where both missing and noisy data are prevalent. To address this problem, we propose a novel noise-robust MER model, named NMER, which effectively learns robust multimodal joint representations from incomplete data containing noise. Our approach incorporates two key components. First, we introduce a noise scheduler that adjusts the type and level of noise in the training data, emulating the characteristics of incomplete data in realistic scenarios. Second, we employ a Variational AutoEncoder (VAE)-based NMER model to generate robust multimodal joint representations from the noisy data, leveraging the modality invariant feature.

Privacy-preserving identity attestations can drastically reduce instances of impersonation and make disinformation easy to identify and potentially hinder. By understanding how identity attestations are positioned across the spectrum of decentralization, we can gain a better understanding of the costs and benefits of various attestations. In this paper, we discuss attestation types, including governmental, biometric, federated, and web of trust-based, and include examples such as e-Estonia, China's social credit system, Worldcoin, OAuth, X (formerly Twitter), Gitcoin Passport, and EAS. We believe that the most resilient systems create an identity that evolves and is connected to a network of similarly evolving identities that verify one another. In this type of system, each entity contributes its respective credibility to the attestation process, creating a larger, more comprehensive set of attestations. We believe these systems could be the best approach to authenticating identity and protecting against some of the threats to democracy that AI can pose in the hands of malicious actors. However, governments will likely attempt to mitigate these risks by implementing centralized identity authentication systems; these centralized systems could themselves pose risks to the democratic processes they are built to defend.

MLaaS provides inference service with low inference latency to application users based on an ML model trained using a dataset collected from numerous individual data owners. Recently, for the sake of data owners' privacy and to comply with the \"right to be forgotten (RTBF)\" as enacted by data protection legislation, many machine unlearning methods have been proposed to remove data owners' data from trained models upon their unlearning requests. However, despite their promising efficiency, almost all existing machine unlearning methods handle unlearning requests in a manner that is independent of inference requests, which unfortunately introduces new security and privacy vulnerabilities for machine unlearning in MLaaS.

The neural conversational model employed to respond to user utterances relies on a simple but effective graph-to-text mechanism that traverses the dialogue state graph and converts the traversals into a natural language form.

One of the major challenges in e-commerce is the large volume of spatio-temporally diverse orders from multiple customers, each of which has to be fulfilled from one of several warehouses using a fleet of vehicles. This results in two levels of decision-making: (i) selection of a fulfillment node for each order (including the option of deferral to a future time), and then (ii) routing of vehicles (each of which can carry multiple orders originating from the same warehouse). We propose an approach that combines graph neural networks and reinforcement learning to train the node selection and vehicle routing agents. We include real-world constraints such as warehouse inventory capacity, vehicle characteristics such as travel times, service times, carrying capacity, and customer constraints including time windows for delivery. The complexity of this problem arises from the fact that outcomes (rewards) are driven both by the fulfillment node mapping as well as the routing algorithms, and are spatio-temporally distributed. Our experiments show that this algorithmic pipeline outperforms pure heuristic policies.","creator":"Omkar Shelke, Pranavi Pathakota, Anandsingh Chauhan, Harshad Khadilkar, Hardik Meisheri, Balaraman Ravindran"},{"id":"2311.16172","slug":"evolutionary-machine-learning-and-games-arxiv-2311-16172v1-cs-ne","title":"Evolutionary Machine Learning and Games.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16172","abstract":"Evolutionary machine learning (EML) has been applied to games in multiple ways, and for multiple different purposes.

Thus, we propose MACE, a Multi-pattern Accommodated and efficient Anomaly detection method in the frequency domain for time series anomaly detection. There are three novel characteristics of it: (i) a pattern extraction mechanism excelling at handling diverse normal patterns, which enables the model to identify anomalies by examining the correlation between the data sample and its service normal pattern, instead of solely focusing on the data sample itself; (ii) a dualistic convolution mechanism that amplifies short-term anomalies in the time domain and hinders the reconstruction of anomalies in the frequency domain, which enlarges the reconstruction error disparity between anomaly and normality and facilitates anomaly detection; (iii) leveraging the sparsity and parallelism of frequency domain to enhance model efficiency. We theoretically and experimentally prove that using a strategically selected subset of Fourier bases can not only reduce computational overhead but is also profit to distinguish anomalies, compared to using the complete spectrum.

In this work we present our Coreference Resolution in Question-Answering (CRaQAn) dataset, an open-source dataset that caters to the nuanced information retrieval requirements of coreference resolution in question-answering tasks by providing over 250 question-answer pairs containing coreferences. To develop this dataset, we developed a novel approach for creating high-quality datasets using an instruction-following model (GPT-4) and a Recursive Criticism and Improvement Loop.","creator":"Rob Grzywinski, Joshua D&#x27;Arcy, Rob Naidoff, Ashish Shukla, Alex Browne, Ren Gibbons, Brinnae Bent"},{"id":"2311.16339","slug":"reward-shaping-for-improved-learning-in-real-time-strategy-game-play-arxiv-2311-16339v1-cs-lg","title":"Reward Shaping for Improved Learning in Real-time Strategy Game Play.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16339","abstract":"We investigate the effect of reward shaping in improving the performance of reinforcement learning in the context of the real-time strategy, capture-the-flag game.

The majority of existing models focus on single-defender settings where a single entity assumes command of all security assets. However, many realistic scenarios feature multiple heterogeneous defenders with their own interests and priorities embedded in a more complex system. Furthermore, defenders rarely choose targets to protect. Instead, they have a multitude of defensive resources or schedules at its disposal, each with different protective capabilities. In this paper, we study security games featuring multiple defenders and schedules simultaneously. We show that unlike prior work on multi-defender security games, the introduction of schedules can cause non-existence of equilibrium even under rather restricted environments. We prove that under the mild restriction that any subset of a schedule is also a schedule, non-existence of equilibrium is not only avoided, but can be computed in polynomial time in games with two defenders. Under additional assumptions, our algorithm can be extended to games with more than two defenders and its computation scaled up in special classes of games with compactly represented schedules such as those used in patrolling applications. Experimental results suggest that our methods scale gracefully with game size, making our algorithms amongst the few that can tackle multiple heterogeneous defenders.","creator":"Zimeng Song, Chun Kai Ling, Fei Fang"},{"id":"2311.16424","slug":"manifold-preserving-guided-diffusion-arxiv-2311-16424v1-cs-lg","title":"Manifold Preserving Guided Diffusion.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16424","abstract":"Despite the recent advancements, conditional image generation still faces challenges of cost, generalizability, and the need for task-specific training.

Efficient Post-training Quantization (PTQ) is pivotal for addressing these issues in traditional models. Different from traditional models, diffusion models heavily depend on the time-step $t$ to achieve satisfactory multi-round denoising. Usually, $t$ from the finite set $\\{1, \\ldots, T\\}$ is encoded to a temporal feature by a few modules totally irrespective of the sampling data. However, existing PTQ methods do not optimize these modules separately. They adopt inappropriate reconstruction targets and complex calibration methods, resulting in a severe disturbance of the temporal feature and denoising trajectory, as well as a low compression efficiency. To solve these, we propose a Temporal Feature Maintenance Quantization (TFMQ) framework building upon a Temporal Information Block which is just related to the time-step $t$ and unrelated to the sampling data. Powered by the pioneering block design, we devise temporal information aware reconstruction (TIAR) and finite set calibration (FSC) to align the full-precision temporal features in a limited time. Equipped with the framework, we can maintain the most temporal information and ensure the end-to-end generation quality. Extensive experiments on various datasets and diffusion models prove our state-of-the-art results. Remarkably, our quantization approach, for the first time, achieves model performance nearly on par with the full-precision model under 4-bit weight quantization.

An effective representation of drug molecules emerges as a pivotal component in this pursuit. Contemporary leading-edge research predominantly resorts to self-supervised learning (SSL) techniques to extract meaningful structural representations from large-scale, unlabeled molecular data, subsequently fine-tuning these representations for an array of downstream tasks. However, an inherent shortcoming of these studies lies in their singular reliance on one modality of molecular information, such as molecule image or SMILES representations, thus neglecting the potential complementarity of various molecular modalities. In response to this limitation, we propose MolIG, a novel MultiModaL molecular pre-training framework for predicting molecular properties based on Image and Graph structures. MolIG model innovatively leverages the coherence and correlation between molecule graph and molecule image to execute self-supervised tasks, effectively amalgamating the strengths of both molecular representation forms. This holistic approach allows for the capture of pivotal molecular structural characteristics and high-level semantic information. Upon completion of pre-training, Graph Neural Network (GNN) Encoder is used for the prediction of downstream tasks. In comparison to advanced baseline models, MolIG exhibits enhanced performance in downstream tasks pertaining to molecular property prediction within benchmark groups such as MoleculeNet Benchmark Group and ADMET Benchmark Group.","creator":"Zhuoyuan Wang, Jiacong Mi, Shan Lu, Jieyue He"},{"id":"2311.16671","slug":"splitnerf-split-sum-approximation-neural-field-for-joint-geometry-illumination-and-material-estimation-arxiv-2311-16671v1-cs-cv","title":"SplitNeRF: Split Sum Approximation Neural Field for Joint Geometry, Illumination, and Material Estimation.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16671","abstract":"We present a novel approach for digitizing real-world objects by estimating their geometry, material properties, and environmental lighting from a set of posed images with fixed lighting.

In this work, we present a novel post-hoc concept-based XAI framework that conveys besides instance-wise (local) also class-wise (global) decision-making strategies via prototypes.

However, existing approaches seldom consider the hyper-relations in LBSN, such as the mobility relation (a 3-ary relation: user-POI-time). This makes the model hard to exploit the semantics accurately. In addition, prior works overlook the rich structural information inherent in KG, which consists of higher-order relations and can further alleviate the impact of data sparsity.To this end, we propose a Hyper-Relational Knowledge Graph Neural Network (HKGNN) model.

This oversight may lead to issues like the accumulation of training bias within shallower student layers, potentially compromising the effectiveness of KD. To address these challenges, we propose Hierarchical Layer-selective Feedback Distillation (HLFD). HLFD strategically distills knowledge from a combination of middle layers to earlier layers and transfers final layer knowledge to intermediate layers at both the feature and pixel levels. This design allows the model to learn higher-quality representations from earlier layers, resulting in a robust and compact student model. Extensive quantitative evaluations reveal that HLFD outperforms existing methods by a significant margin. For example, in the kidney segmentation task, HLFD surpasses the student model (without KD) by over 10pp, significantly improving its focus on tumor-specific features. From a qualitative standpoint, the student model trained using HLFD excels at suppressing irrelevant information and can focus sharply on tumor-specific details, which opens a new pathway for more efficient and accurate diagnostic tools.","creator":"Vandan Gorade, Sparsh Mittal, Debesh Jha, Ulas Bagci"},{"id":"2311.16711","slug":"ledits-limitless-image-editing-using-text-to-image-models-arxiv-2311-16711v1-cs-cv","title":"LEDITS++: Limitless Image Editing using Text-to-Image Models.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16711","abstract":"Text-to-image diffusion models have recently received increasing interest for their astonishing ability to produce high-fidelity images from solely text inputs.

We also hypothesize and verify that the model experiences forgetting events during training, leading to unstable learning. To mitigate these issues, we investigate two approaches. The first focuses on modifying the training dynamics. Flatter minima implicitly alleviate forgetting, so we optimize for flatter loss basins and show that the model stably memorizes more documents ($+12\\%$). Next, we introduce a generative memory to sample pseudo-queries for documents and supplement them during continual indexing to prevent forgetting for the retrieval task. Extensive experiments on novel continual indexing benchmarks based on Natural Questions (NQ) and MS MARCO demonstrate that our proposed solution mitigates forgetting significantly. Concretely, it improves the average Hits@10 by $+21.1\\%$ over competitive baselines for NQ and requires $6$ times fewer model updates compared to re-training the DSI model for incrementally indexing five corpora in a sequence.","creator":"Sanket Vaibhav Mehta, Jai Gupta, Yi Tay, Mostafa Dehghani, Vinh Q.

We carry out an extensive technical evaluation of ChatGPT using 23 data sets covering 8 different common NLP application tasks. We evaluate the multitask, multilingual and multi-modal aspects of ChatGPT based on these data sets and a newly designed multimodal dataset. We find that ChatGPT outperforms LLMs with zero-shot learning on most tasks and even outperforms fine-tuned models on some tasks. We find that it is better at understanding non-Latin script languages than generating them. It is able to generate multimodal content from textual prompts, via an intermediate code generation step. Moreover, we find that ChatGPT is 63.41% accurate on average in 10 different reasoning categories under logical reasoning, non-textual reasoning, and commonsense reasoning, hence making it an unreliable reasoner. It is, for example, better at deductive than inductive reasoning. ChatGPT suffers from hallucination problems like other LLMs and it generates more extrinsic hallucinations from its parametric memory as it does not have access to an external knowledge base. Finally, the interactive feature of ChatGPT enables human collaboration with the underlying LLM to improve its performance, i.e, 8% ROUGE-1 on summarization and 2% ChrF++ on machine translation, in a multi-turn \"prompt engineering\" fashion.

In the context of graph-based semi-supervised learning (SSL), resource constraints often lead to scenarios where the dataset is large, but only a portion of it can be labeled, affecting the model's performance. This limitation affects tasks like anomaly detection or spam detection when labeling processes are biased or influenced by human subjectivity. To tackle the challenges posed by localized training data, we approach the problem as an out-of-distribution (OOD) data issue by by aligning the distributions between the training data, which represents a small portion of labeled data, and the graph inference process that involves making predictions for the entire graph. We propose a regularization method to minimize distributional discrepancies between localized training data and graph inference, improving model performance on OOD data. Extensive tests on popular GNN models show significant performance improvement on three citation GNN benchmark datasets. The regularization approach effectively enhances model adaptation and generalization, overcoming challenges posed by OOD data.","creator":"Akansha A"},{"id":"2307.16769","slug":"2-level-reinforcement-learning-for-ships-on-inland-waterways-arxiv-2307-16769v2-cs-sy-updated","title":"2-Level Reinforcement Learning for Ships on Inland Waterways.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.16769","abstract":"This paper proposes a realistic modularized framework for controlling autonomous surface vehicles (ASVs) on inland waterways (IWs) based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL). The framework comprises two levels: a high-level local path planning (LPP) unit and a low-level path following (PF) unit, each consisting of a DRL agent. The LPP agent is responsible for planning a path under consideration of nearby vessels, traffic rules, and the geometry of the waterway. We thereby transfer a recently proposed spatial-temporal recurrent neural network architecture to continuous action spaces. The LPP agent improves operational safety in comparison to a state-of-the-art artificial potential field method by increasing the minimum distance to other vessels by 65% on average. The PF agent performs low-level actuator control while accounting for shallow water influences and the environmental forces winds, waves, and currents. Compared with a proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller, the PF agent yields only 61% of the mean cross-track error while significantly reducing control effort in terms of the required absolute rudder angle. Lastly, both agents are jointly validated in simulation, employing the lower Elbe in northern Germany as an example case and using real automatic identification system (AIS) trajectories to model the behavior of other ships.","creator":"Martin Waltz, Niklas Paulig, Ostap Okhrin"},{"id":"2308.12532","slug":"fedsol-stabilized-orthogonal-learning-in-federated-learning-arxiv-2308-12532v3-cs-lg-updated","title":"FedSOL: Stabilized Orthogonal Learning in Federated Learning.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12532","abstract":"Federated Learning (FL) aggregates locally trained models from individual clients to construct a global model. While FL enables learning a model with data privacy, it often suffers from significant performance degradation when client data distributions are heterogeneous. Many previous FL algorithms have addressed this issue by introducing various proximal restrictions. These restrictions aim to encourage global alignment by constraining the deviation of local learning from the global objective. However, they inherently limit local learning by interfering with the original local objectives. Recently, an alternative approach has emerged to improve local learning generality. By obtaining local models within a smooth loss landscape, this approach mitigates conflicts among different local objectives of the clients. Yet, it does not ensure stable global alignment, as local learning does not take the global objective into account. In this study, we propose Federated Stability on Learning (FedSoL), which combines both the concepts of global alignment and local generality. In FedSoL, the local learning seeks a parameter region robust against proximal perturbations. This strategy introduces an implicit proximal restriction effect in local learning while maintaining the original local objective for parameter update. Our experiments show that FedSoL consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance on various setups.","creator":"Gihun Lee, Minchan Jeong, Sangmook Kim, Jaehoon Oh, Se-Young Yun"},{"id":"2308.14610","slug":"polarrec-radio-interferometric-data-reconstruction-with-polar-coordinate-representation-arxiv-2308-14610v2-astro-ph-im-updated","title":"PolarRec: Radio Interferometric Data Reconstruction with Polar Coordinate Representation.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.14610","abstract":"In radio astronomy, visibility data, which are measurements of wave signals from radio telescopes, are transformed into images for observation of distant celestial objects. However, these resultant images usually contain both real sources and artifacts, due to signal sparsity and other factors. One way to obtain cleaner images is to reconstruct samples into dense forms before imaging. Unfortunately, existing reconstruction methods often miss some components of visibility in frequency domain, so blurred object edges and persistent artifacts remain in the images. Furthermore, the computation overhead is high on irregular visibility samples due to the data skew. To address these problems, we propose PolarRec, a transformer-encoder-conditioned reconstruction pipeline with visibility samples converted into the polar coordinate representation. This representation matches the way in which radio telescopes observe a celestial area as the Earth rotates. As a result, visibility samples distribute in the polar system more uniformly than in the Cartesian space. Therefore, we propose to use radial distance in the loss function, to help reconstruct complete visibility effectively. Also, we group visibility samples by their polar angles and propose a group-based encoding scheme to improve the efficiency. Our experiments demonstrate that PolarRec markedly improves imaging results by faithfully reconstructing all frequency components in the visibility domain while significantly reducing the computation cost in visibility data encoding. We believe this high-quality and high-efficiency imaging of PolarRec will better facilitate astronomers to conduct their research.","creator":"Ruoqi Wang, Zhuoyang Chen, Jiayi Zhu, Qiong Luo, Feng Wang"},{"id":"2308.15568","slug":"over-squashing-in-graph-neural-networks-a-comprehensive-survey-arxiv-2308-15568v5-cs-ai-updated","title":"Over-Squashing in Graph Neural Networks: A Comprehensive survey.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.15568","abstract":"Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) revolutionize machine learning for graph-structured data, effectively capturing complex relationships.

However, such safety measures are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, which add maliciously designed token sequences to a harmful prompt to bypass the model's safety guards. In this work, we introduce erase-and-check, the first framework to defend against adversarial prompts with verifiable safety guarantees. We defend against three attack modes: i) adversarial suffix, which appends an adversarial sequence at the end of the prompt; ii) adversarial insertion, where the adversarial sequence is inserted anywhere in the middle of the prompt; and iii) adversarial infusion, where adversarial tokens are inserted at arbitrary positions in the prompt, not necessarily as a contiguous block. Our experimental results demonstrate that this procedure can obtain strong certified safety guarantees on harmful prompts while maintaining good empirical performance on safe prompts. For example, against adversarial suffixes of length 20, it certifiably detects 92% of harmful prompts and labels 94% of safe prompts correctly using the open-source language model Llama 2 as the safety filter. We further improve the filter's performance, in terms of accuracy and speed, by replacing Llama 2 with a DistilBERT safety classifier fine-tuned on safe and harmful prompts.

This process is crucial for various genomic analyses, including variant calling, transcriptomics, and epigenomics. Conventional methods, refined over decades, tackle this challenge in two steps: genome indexing followed by efficient search to locate likely positions for given reads. Building on the success of Large Language Models (LLM) in encoding text into embeddings, where the distance metric captures semantic similarity, recent efforts have explored whether the same Transformer architecture can produce numerical representations for DNA sequences. Such models have shown early promise in tasks involving classification of short DNA sequences, such as the detection of coding vs non-coding regions, as well as the identification of enhancer and promoter sequences. Performance at sequence classification tasks does not, however, translate to sequence alignment, where it is necessary to conduct a genome-wide search to successfully align every read. We address this open problem by framing it as an Embed-Search-Align task. In this framework, a novel encoder model DNA-ESA generates representations of reads and fragments of the reference, which are projected into a shared vector space where the read-fragment distance is used as surrogate for alignment. In particular, DNA-ESA introduces: (1) Contrastive loss for self-supervised training of DNA sequence representations, facilitating rich sequence-level embeddings, and (2) a DNA vector store to enable search across fragments on a global scale. DNA-ESA is &gt;97% accurate when aligning 250-length reads onto a human reference genome of 3 gigabases (single-haploid), far exceeds the performance of 6 recent DNA-Transformer model baselines and shows task transfer across chromosomes and species.","creator":"Pavan Holur, K.

These time-embeddings are leveraged in pretext tasks, to incorporate smooth and fine-grained temporal dependencies in the representations, as well as reinforce robustness to missing data. We evaluate T-Rep on downstream classification, forecasting, and anomaly detection tasks.

As we can expect from the results of a random search program, Lion incorporates elements from several existing algorithms, including signed momentum, decoupled weight decay, Polak, and Nesterov momentum, but does not fit into any existing category of theoretically grounded optimizers. Thus, even though Lion appears to perform well as a general-purpose optimizer for a wide range of tasks, its theoretical basis remains uncertain. This lack of theoretical clarity limits opportunities to further enhance and expand Lion's efficacy.  This work aims to demystify Lion. Based on both continuous-time and discrete-time analysis, we demonstrate that Lion is a theoretically novel and principled approach for minimizing a general loss function $f(x)$ while enforcing a bound constraint $\\|x\\|_\\infty \\leq 1/\\lambda$. Lion achieves this through the incorporation of decoupled weight decay, where $\\lambda$ represents the weight decay coefficient.

Prior work suggests that language models (LMs) often fall short on inductive reasoning, despite achieving impressive success on research benchmarks. In this work, we conduct a systematic study of the inductive reasoning capabilities of LMs through iterative hypothesis refinement, a technique that more closely mirrors the human inductive process than standard input-output prompting. Iterative hypothesis refinement employs a three-step process: proposing, selecting, and refining hypotheses in the form of textual rules. By examining the intermediate rules, we observe that LMs are phenomenal hypothesis proposers (i.e., generating candidate rules), and when coupled with a (task-specific) symbolic interpreter that is able to systematically filter the proposed set of rules, this hybrid approach achieves strong results across inductive reasoning benchmarks that require inducing causal relations, language-like instructions, and symbolic concepts. However, they also behave as puzzling inductive reasoners, showing notable performance gaps between rule induction (i.e., identifying plausible rules) and rule application (i.e., applying proposed rules to instances), suggesting that LMs are proposing hypotheses without being able to actually apply the rules. Through empirical and human analyses, we further reveal several discrepancies between the inductive reasoning processes of LMs and humans, shedding light on both the potentials and limitations of using LMs in inductive reasoning tasks.","creator":"Linlu Qiu, Liwei Jiang, Ximing Lu, Melanie Sclar, Valentina Pyatkin, Chandra Bhagavatula, Bailin Wang, Yoon Kim, Yejin Choi, Nouha Dziri, Xiang Ren"},{"id":"2310.08659","slug":"loftq-lora-fine-tuning-aware-quantization-for-large-language-models-arxiv-2310-08659v4-cs-cl-updated","title":"LoftQ: LoRA-Fine-Tuning-Aware Quantization for Large Language Models.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08659","abstract":"Quantization is an indispensable technique for serving Large Language Models (LLMs) and has recently found its way into LoRA fine-tuning.

However, solving more complex and competitive programming tasks is still quite challenging for these models - possibly due to their tendency to generate solutions as monolithic code blocks instead of decomposing them into logical sub-tasks and sub-modules. On the other hand, experienced programmers instinctively write modularized code with abstraction for solving complex tasks, often reusing previously developed modules. To address this gap, we propose CodeChain, a novel framework for inference that elicits modularized code generation through a chain of self-revisions, each being guided by some representative sub-modules generated in previous iterations. Concretely, CodeChain first instructs the LLM to generate modularized codes through chain-of-thought prompting. Then it applies a chain of self-revisions by iterating the two steps: 1) extracting and clustering the generated sub-modules and selecting the cluster representatives as the more generic and re-usable implementations, and 2) augmenting the original chain-of-thought prompt with these selected module-implementations and instructing the LLM to re-generate new modularized solutions. We find that by naturally encouraging the LLM to reuse the previously developed and verified sub-modules, CodeChain can significantly boost both modularity as well as correctness of the generated solutions, achieving relative pass@1 improvements of 35% on APPS and 76% on CodeContests. It is shown to be effective on both OpenAI LLMs as well as open-sourced LLMs like WizardCoder. We also conduct comprehensive ablation studies with different methods of prompting, number of clusters, model sizes, program qualities, etc., to provide useful insights that underpin CodeChain's success.","creator":"Hung Le, Hailin Chen, Amrita Saha, Akash Gokul, Doyen Sahoo, Shafiq Joty"},{"id":"2310.09843","slug":"cocoformer-a-controllable-feature-rich-polyphonic-music-generation-method-arxiv-2310-09843v2-cs-sd-updated","title":"CoCoFormer: A controllable feature-rich polyphonic music generation method.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.09843","abstract":"This paper explores the modeling method of polyphonic music sequence.

However, the inherent black-box nature of these models poses challenges for their clinical application. This study aims to enhance transparency in DL-based gait classification for aged-related gait patterns using Explainable Artificial Intelligence, such as SHAP.  A total of 244 subjects, comprising 129 adults and 115 older adults (age&gt;65), were included. They performed a 3-minute walking task while accelerometers were affixed to the lumbar segment L3. DL models, convolutional neural network (CNN) and gated recurrent unit (GRU), were trained using 1-stride and 8-stride accelerations, respectively, to classify adult and older adult groups. SHAP was employed to explain the models' predictions.  CNN achieved a satisfactory performance with an accuracy of 81.4% and an AUC of 0.89, and GRU demonstrated promising results with an accuracy of 84.5% and an AUC of 0.94. SHAP analysis revealed that both CNN and GRU assigned higher SHAP values to the data from vertical and walking directions, particularly emphasizing data around heel contact, spanning from the terminal swing to loading response phases. Furthermore, SHAP values indicated that GRU did not treat every stride equally.  CNN accurately distinguished between adults and older adults based on the characteristics of a single stride's data. GRU achieved accurate classification by considering the relationships and subtle differences between strides. In both models, data around heel contact emerged as most critical, suggesting differences in acceleration and deceleration patterns during walking between different age groups.","creator":"Xiaoping Zheng, Bert Otten, Michiel F Reneman, Claudine JC Lamoth"},{"id":"2311.12824","slug":"comparative-analysis-of-shear-strength-prediction-models-for-reinforced-concrete-slab-column-connections-arxiv-2311-12824v2-cs-ne-updated","title":"Comparative Analysis of Shear Strength Prediction Models for Reinforced Concrete Slab-Column Connections.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12824","abstract":"This research aims at comparative analysis of shear strength prediction at slab-column connection, unifying machine learning, design codes and Finite Element Analysis.

Microalgae have also been recognized as sustainable source of biomass to complement crops. For this objective they are cultivated in photobioreactors or ponds at high cell density to maximize biomass productivity and lower the cost of downstream processes. Photosynthesis depends on light availability, that is often not constant over time. In nature, sunlight fluctuates over diurnal cycles and weather conditions. In high-density microalgae cultures of photobioreactors outdoors, on top of natural variations, microalgae are subjected to further complexity in light exposure. Because of the high-density cells experience self-shading effects that heavily limit light availability in most of the mass culture volume. This limitation strongly affects biomass productivity of industrial microalgae cultivation plants with important implication on economic feasibility. Understanding how photosynthesis responds to cell density is informative to assess functionality in the inhomogeneous light environment of industrial photobioreactors. In this work we exploited a high-sensitivity Clark electrode to measure microalgae photosynthesis and compare cultures with different densities, using Nannochloropsis as model organism. We observed that cell density has a substantial impact on photosynthetic activity, and demonstrated the reduction of the cell's light-absorption capacity by genetic modification is a valuable strategy to increase photosynthetic functionality of dense microalgae cultures.","creator":"Vera-Vives, A.

In a field experiment and a caged outdoor pot experiment, a total of 18 genotypes (14 inbred lines, 4 F1 hybrids) of faba bean were evaluated for pollen production, pollen viability and autofertility.

For the incompatible soybean varieties, B. altitudinis showed lower bacterial density and provided no seed protection. Collectively, this study advances the insight of B. altitudinis conferring seed rot resistance.

While white canal-1 leaves are devoid of chlorophyll, green leaves of the mutant appear wild-type-like, despite an impaired protein function. Transcriptomic data suggest that green mutant leaves compensate for this impaired protein function by upregulation of transcription of photosystem assembly and photosystem component genes, thereby allowing adequate photosystem establishment, which is reflected in their wild-type-like proteome. White canal-1 leaves, however, likely fail to reach a certain threshold enabling this overcompensation, and plastids get trapped in an undeveloped state, while additionally suffering from high light stress, indicated by the overexpression of ELIP homolog genes. The metabolic profile of white and to a lesser degree also green tissues revealed upregulation of amino acid levels, that was at least partially mediated by transcriptional and proteomic upregulation.

Plants constantly face the challenge of balancing light and dark reactions under varying environmental conditions. Nuclear RNA binding proteins (RBPs) play a crucial role in plant acclimation to these changes through post-transcriptional processes. Mutants of chloroplast gene expression factors often exhibit impaired chloroplast biogenesis, especially in cold conditions. Cold temperatures pose a challenge for plants as they slow down Calvin Cycle enzymes, potentially leading to a shortage of electron acceptors and oxidative damage from excess electrons in the thylakoid membrane. A well-known response of plants to this problem is to increase the production of RuBisCo and other Calvin Cycle enzymes in the cold. The chloroplast RNA binding protein CP29A targets rbcL mRNA and is essential for cold resistance in Arabidopsis thaliana. This effect is confined to the youngest leaf tissue and is linked to its role in enhancing the splicing of various chloroplast RNAs in cold conditions. In this study, we utilized enhanced cross-linking and immunoprecipitation (eCLIP) and RNA- Bind-N-Seq (RBNS) to investigate the RNA targets of CP29A, achieving nucleotide-resolution insights into protein-RNA interaction sites. We discovered that CP29A preferentially binds to mRNAs encoding subunits of photosystem II. Notably, one of the most confidently identified targets of CP29A is the 5-UTR of rbcL, where it interacts with a site downstream of the pentatricopeptide repeat protein MRL1, a crucial player in rbcL accumulation. Arabidopsis mutants lacking CP29A showed no significant rbcL changes, possibly due to CP29As restricted role in a limited number of cells at the base of leaves. In contrast, CRISPR mutants of tobacco NtCP29A exhibit photosynthetic deficiencies throughout the entire leaf blade, correlating with a substantial decrease in both rbcL mRNA and RbcL protein levels. Conclusively, our study establishes CP29A as a pioneer regulator in sustaining optimal RuBisCo expression during cold acclimation, highlighting its integral role in plant cold response mechanisms.","creator":"Lenzen, B., Roesch, F., Ruwe, H., Legen, J., Small, I.

However, morphologic a l studies on the vascular anatomy of cereal crops, and inflorescences in particular, are scarce despite their importance for grain yield determination. Here, using barley (Hordeum vulgare) as a model, we study the vascular anatomy of the spike-type inflorescence. Our goal is to clarify the relationship between rachis (spike axis) vasculature and spike size, the implications for transport capacity and its interaction with the spikelets.  MethodsWe employed serial transversal internode sections in multiple barley lines with different spike size, and investigated the internode diameter, vascular area and vein number size along the mature barley rachis. We then modeled the vascular dynamics along the main spike axis, and analyzed their relationship with spike size.  Key resultsInternode diameter and total vascular area have a clear positive correlation with spike size whereas vascular number is only weakly correlated. While the lateral periphery of the rachis contains large mature veins of constant diameter the central part is occupied by a staggered array of small immature veins. This underlines the importance of minimizing transport resistance and suggests that transport and distribution of nutrients are spatially separated. Spikelet-derived veins enter the rachis either in the central area, where they often merge with the immature rachis veins, or in the periphery where they do not merge with the large mature veins. An increase in floret fertility through the conversion of a two-rowed barley into an isogenic six-rowed line, as well a decrease in floret fertility due to enhanced pre-anthesis tip degeneration caused by the mutation tip sterile 2.b (tst2.b) significantly affected vein size, but had limited to no effects on vein number or rachis diameter. Comparative analysis of a wild barley accession suggests that the domestication of barley may have favored plants with enhanced rachis transport capacity.  ConclusionsThe rachis vasculature is the result of a two-step process involving an initial lay-out followed by size adjustment according to floret fertility/spike size. The functional processes of long distance transport and local supply to spikelets are spatially separated while a vascular continuity between rachis and spikelets appears non-essential.","creator":"Rutten, T., Thirulogachandar, V., Huang, Y., Shanmugaraj, N., Koppolu, R., Ortleb, S., Hensel, G., Kumlehn, J., Melzer, M., Schnurbusch, T."},{"id":"2023.11.23.568411v1","slug":"smerf6-promotes-the-expression-of-terpenoid-pathway-in-salvia-officinalis-and-improves-the-production-of-high-value-abietane-diterpenes-carnosol-and-carnosic-acid","title":"SmERF6 promotes the expression of terpenoid pathway in Salvia officinalis and improves the production of high value abietane diterpenes, carnosol and carnosic acid","link":"http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2023.11.23.568411v1?rss=1","abstract":"Carnosol (CO) and carnosic acid (CA) are pharmaceutically important diterpenes predominantly produced in members of Lamiaceae, Salvia officinalis, Salvia fruticosa and Rosmarinus officinalis.

Bryopsis is a representative coenocytic alga that has exceptionally high regeneration ability: extruded cytoplasm aggregates rapidly in seawater, leading to the formation of protoplasts. However, the genetic basis of the unique cell biology of Bryopsis remains poorly understood. Here, we present a high-quality assembly and annotation of the nuclear genome of Bryopsis sp. (90.7 Mbp, 27 contigs, N50 = 6.7 Mbp, 14,034 protein-coding genes). Comparative genomic analyses indicate that the genes encoding BPL-1/Bryohealin, the aggregation-promoting lectin, are heavily duplicated in Bryopsis, whereas homologous genes are absent in other Ulvophycean algae, suggesting the basis of regeneration capability of Bryopsis. Bryopsis sp. possesses >30 kinesins but only a single myosin, which differs from other green algae that have multiple types of myosin genes. Consistent with this biased motor toolkit, we observed that the bidirectional motility of chloroplasts in the cytoplasm was dependent on microtubules but not actin in Bryopsis sp. Unexpectedly, most genes required for cytokinesis in plants are present in Bryopsis, including those in the SNARE or kinesin superfamily. Nevertheless, a kinesin crucial for cytokinesis initiation in plants (NACK/Kinesin-7II) is hardly expressed in the coenocytic part of the thallus, possibly underlying the lack of cytokinesis in this portion. The present genome sequence lays the foundation for experimental biology in coenocytic macroalgae.  Significance statementThe exceptionally coenocytic body and remarkable regeneration ability of Bryopsis have attracted biologists for years. However, molecular biological tools remain underdeveloped, partly due to the lack of genome information. Here, we report high-quality assembly and annotation of the genome, providing a crucial resource for experimental biology and genomics studies of Bryopsis. Furthermore, comparative genomic analysis reveals a unique gene repertoire that possibly underlies the highly regenerative coenocytic body.","creator":"Ochiai, K. K., Hanawa, D., Ogawa, H.

Although the dynamics of photosynthesis have been widely investigated in terms of CO2 exchange measurements, a more comprehensive view can be obtained when combining gas exchange and chlorophyll fluorescence (ChlF) measurements. However, such integrated measurements have been so far restricted to short term analysis using portable systems that combine IRGA and PAM-ChlF techniques. Here we introduce and demonstrate a new method for integrated, long-term and in situ measurements of leaf gas exchange and ChlF, based on an autonomous gas exchange system and a new miniature PAM- fluorometer. The method is used to simultaneously track the dynamics of the light and carbon reactions of photosynthesis at a 20-minute resolution in leaves of silver birch during summer time. The potential of the method is initially demonstrated using the ratio between electron transport and net assimilation (ETR/ANET). We successfully captured the diurnal patterns in the ETR/ANET during summer time, including a drastic increase in ETR/ANET upon a high-temperature period. We suggest that these measurements can provide valuable data to model and quantify the regulation of leaf photosynthesis in situ.

In animals, several models have been proposed to explain how enhancers integrate the activity of multiple transcription factors. However, it remains largely unknown how plant enhancers integrate transcription factor activity. Here, we use Plant STARR-seq to characterize three light-responsive plant enhancers--AB80, Cab-1, and rbcS-E9--derived from genes active in photosynthesis. Saturation mutagenesis reveals mutations, many of which cluster in short regions, that strongly reduce enhancer activity in the light, in the dark or in both conditions. When tested in the light, these mutation-sensitive regions do not function on their own; rather, cooperative interactions with other such regions are required for full activity. Epistatic interactions occur between mutations in adjacent mutation-sensitive regions, and the spacing and order of mutation-sensitive regions in synthetic enhancers affects enhancer activity. In contrast, when tested in the dark, mutation-sensitive regions act independently and additively in conferring enhancer activity. Taken together, this work demonstrates that plant enhancers show evidence for both cooperative and additive interactions among their functional elements. This knowledge can be harnessed to design strong, condition-specific synthetic enhancers.","creator":"Jores, T., Tonnies, J., Mueth, N.

Second, we introduce a volatility emphasis constraint that breaks mean/variance indeterminacy in this class of overparametrized nonlinear models. Third, we conduct a blocked out-of-bag reality check to curb overfitting in both conditional moments. Fourth, the algorithm utilizes standard deep learning software and thus handles large data sets - both computationally and statistically.

We evaluate point and density forecasts with an extensive out-of-sample experiment and benchmark against a suite of models ranging from classics to more modern machine learning-based offerings. In all cases, HNN fares well by consistently providing accurate mean/variance forecasts for all targets and horizons.

Such trades are enabled by the assets deposited by liquidity providers (LPs). The goal of this paper is to characterize and interpret the optimal (i.e., profit-maximizing) strategy of a monopolist liquidity provider, as a function of that LP's beliefs about asset prices and trader behavior. We introduce a general framework for reasoning about AMMs based on a Bayesian-like belief inference framework, where LPs maintain an asset price estimate. In this model, the market maker (i.e., LP) chooses a demand curve that specifies the quantity of a risky asset to be held at each dollar price. Traders arrive sequentially and submit a price bid that can be interpreted as their estimate of the risky asset price; the AMM responds to this submitted bid with an allocation of the risky asset to the trader, a payment that the trader must pay, and a revised internal estimate for the true asset price. We define an incentive-compatible (IC) AMM as one in which a trader's optimal strategy is to submit its true estimate of the asset price, and characterize the IC AMMs as those with downward-sloping demand curves and payments defined by a formula familiar from Myerson's optimal auction theory. We generalize Myerson's virtual values, and characterize the profit-maximizing IC AMM. The optimal demand curve generally has a jump that can be interpreted as a \"bid-ask spread,\" which we show is caused by a combination of adverse selection risk (dominant when the degree of information asymmetry is large) and monopoly pricing (dominant when asymmetry is small).
