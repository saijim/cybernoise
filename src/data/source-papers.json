We present an abstraction-based analysis framework that consists of constructing a finite Markov Decision Processes (MDP) such that verification of certain property on the finite MDP ensures the satisfaction of probabilistic stability on the PPHS. Further, we present a polynomial-time algorithm for verifying the corresponding property on the MDP.

Up to now, it has not been demonstrated yet how to effectively translate the successes of LLMs in the computer vision field to the medical imaging field which involves high-dimensional and multi-modal medical images. In this paper, we report a feasibility study of building a multi-task CT large image-text (LIT) model for lung cancer diagnosis by combining an LLM and a large image model (LIM). Specifically, the LLM and LIM are used as encoders to perceive multi-modal information under task-specific text prompts, which synergizes multi-source information and task-specific and patient-specific priors for optimized diagnostic performance. The key components of our LIT model and associated techniques are evaluated with an emphasis on 3D lung CT analysis. Our initial results show that the LIT model performs multiple medical tasks well, including lung segmentation, lung nodule detection, and lung cancer classification. Active efforts are in progress to develop large image-language models for superior medical imaging in diverse applications and optimal patient outcomes.","creator":"Chuang Niu, Ge Wang"},{"title":"Adaptive Ensemble Learning: Boosting Model Performance through Intelligent Feature Fusion in Deep Neural Networks.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02653","abstract":"In this paper, we present an Adaptive Ensemble Learning framework that aims to boost the performance of deep neural networks by intelligently fusing features through ensemble learning techniques.

Recently, modified forms of predictive coding (PC), an algorithm with origins in computational neuroscience, have been shown to result in approximately or exactly equal parameter updates to those under backpropagation. Due to this connection, it has been suggested that PC can act as an alternative to backpropagation with desirable properties that may facilitate implementation in neuromorphic systems. Here, we explore these claims using the different contemporary PC variants proposed in the literature. We obtain time complexity bounds for these PC variants which we show are lower-bounded by backpropagation. We also present key properties of these variants that have implications for neurobiological plausibility and their interpretations, particularly from the perspective of standard PC as a variational Bayes algorithm for latent probabilistic models. Our findings shed new light on the connection between the two learning frameworks and suggest that, in its current forms, PC may have more limited potential as a direct replacement of backpropagation than previously envisioned.","creator":"Umais Zahid, Qinghai Guo, Zafeirios Fountas"},{"title":"ACTION++: Improving Semi-supervised Medical Image Segmentation with Adaptive Anatomical Contrast.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02689","abstract":"Medical data often exhibits long-tail distributions with heavy class imbalance, which naturally leads to difficulty in classifying the minority classes (i.e., boundary regions or rare objects). Recent work has significantly improved semi-supervised medical image segmentation in long-tailed scenarios by equipping them with unsupervised contrastive criteria. However, it remains unclear how well they will perform in the labeled portion of data where class distribution is also highly imbalanced. In this work, we present ACTION++, an improved contrastive learning framework with adaptive anatomical contrast for semi-supervised medical segmentation. Specifically, we propose an adaptive supervised contrastive loss, where we first compute the optimal locations of class centers uniformly distributed on the embedding space (i.e., off-line), and then perform online contrastive matching training by encouraging different class features to adaptively match these distinct and uniformly distributed class centers. Moreover, we argue that blindly adopting a constant temperature $\\tau$ in the contrastive loss on long-tailed medical data is not optimal, and propose to use a dynamic $\\tau$ via a simple cosine schedule to yield better separation between majority and minority classes. Empirically, we evaluate ACTION++ on ACDC and LA benchmarks and show that it achieves state-of-the-art across two semi-supervised settings. Theoretically, we analyze the performance of adaptive anatomical contrast and confirm its superiority in label efficiency.","creator":"Chenyu You, Weicheng Dai, Yifei Min, Lawrence Staib, Jas Sekhon, James S.

AI/NLP approaches can assist expert curators in populating these knowledge bases, but current approaches rely on extensive training data, and are not able to populate arbitrary complex nested knowledge schemas.  Here we present Structured Prompt Interrogation and Recursive Extraction of Semantics (SPIRES), a Knowledge Extraction approach that relies on the ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform zero-shot learning (ZSL) and general-purpose query answering from flexible prompts and return information conforming to a specified schema. Given a detailed, user-defined knowledge schema and an input text, SPIRES recursively performs prompt interrogation against GPT-3+ to obtain a set of responses matching the provided schema. SPIRES uses existing ontologies and vocabularies to provide identifiers for all matched elements.  We present examples of use of SPIRES in different domains, including extraction of food recipes, multi-species cellular signaling pathways, disease treatments, multi-step drug mechanisms, and chemical to disease causation graphs. Current SPIRES accuracy is comparable to the mid-range of existing Relation Extraction (RE) methods, but has the advantage of easy customization, flexibility, and, crucially, the ability to perform new tasks in the absence of any training data. This method supports a general strategy of leveraging the language interpreting capabilities of LLMs to assemble knowledge bases, assisting manual knowledge curation and acquisition while supporting validation with publicly-available databases and ontologies external to the LLM.

Any machine learning model will have trouble identifying a fake review, especially for a low resource language like Bengali. We have demonstrated that the proposed semi-supervised GAN-LM architecture (generative adversarial network on top of a pretrained language model) is a viable solution in classifying Bengali fake reviews as the experimental results suggest that even with only 1024 annotated samples, BanglaBERT with semi-supervised GAN (SSGAN) achieved an accuracy of 83.59% and a f1-score of 84.89% outperforming other pretrained language models - BanglaBERT generator, Bangla BERT Base and Bangla-Electra by almost 3%, 4% and 10% respectively in terms of accuracy.

For many years, such use involved extracting vector-space representations of words and using distances among these to predict or understand human behavior in various semantic tasks. In contemporary language AIs, however, it is possible to interrogate the latent structure of conceptual representations using methods nearly identical to those commonly used with human participants. The current work uses two common techniques borrowed from cognitive psychology to estimate and compare lexical-semantic structure in both humans and a well-known AI, the DaVinci variant of GPT-3. In humans, we show that conceptual structure is robust to differences in culture, language, and method of estimation. Structures estimated from AI behavior, while individually fairly consistent with those estimated from human behavior, depend much more upon the particular task used to generate behavior responses--responses generated by the very same model in the two tasks yield estimates of conceptual structure that cohere less with one another than do human structure estimates. The results suggest one important way that knowledge inhering in contemporary AIs can differ from human cognition.","creator":"Siddharth Suresh, Lisa Padua, Kushin Mukherjee, Timothy T Rogers"},{"title":"The Saudi Privacy Policy Dataset.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02757","abstract":"This paper introduces the Saudi Privacy Policy Dataset, a diverse compilation of Arabic privacy policies from various sectors in Saudi Arabia, annotated according to the 10 principles of the Personal Data Protection Law (PDPL); the PDPL was established to be compatible with General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR); one of the most comprehensive data regulations worldwide.

Experiments indicate that our model can achieve a 97.75% success rate of placement with only ~0.26M trainable parameters. Besides, our method generalizes better to both unseen objects and instructions. Moreover, with only 25% training data, we still outperform the top competing approach.","creator":"Zhixuan Xu, Kechun Xu, Yue Wang, Rong Xiong"},{"title":"The Governance of Physical Artificial Intelligence.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02924","abstract":"Physical artificial intelligence can prove to be one of the most important challenges of the artificial intelligence.

The emerging federated KGE (FKGE) collaboratively trains from distributed KGs held among clients while avoiding exchanging clients' sensitive raw KGs, which can still suffer from privacy threats as evidenced in other federated model trainings (e.g., neural networks). However, quantifying and defending against such privacy threats remain unexplored for FKGE which possesses unique properties not shared by previously studied models. In this paper, we conduct the first holistic study of the privacy threat on FKGE from both attack and defense perspectives. For the attack, we quantify the privacy threat by proposing three new inference attacks, which reveal substantial privacy risk by successfully inferring the existence of the KG triple from victim clients. For the defense, we propose DP-Flames, a novel differentially private FKGE with private selection, which offers a better privacy-utility tradeoff by exploiting the entity-binding sparse gradient property of FKGE and comes with a tight privacy accountant by incorporating the state-of-the-art private selection technique. We further propose an adaptive privacy budget allocation policy to dynamically adjust defense magnitude across the training procedure. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that the proposed defense can successfully mitigate the privacy threat by effectively reducing the success rate of inference attacks from $83.1\\%$ to $59.4\\%$ on average with only a modest utility decrease.","creator":"Yuke Hu, Wei Liang, Ruofan Wu, Kai Xiao, Weiqiang Wang, Xiaochen Li, Jinfei Liu, Zhan Qin"},{"title":"Convolutional neural networks for crack detection on flexible road pavements.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02933","abstract":"Flexible road pavements deteriorate primarily due to traffic and adverse environmental conditions.

Different from existing data-driven weather forecast methods, FengWu solves the medium-range forecast problem from a multi-modal and multi-task perspective. Specifically, a deep learning architecture equipped with model-specific encoder-decoders and cross-modal fusion Transformer is elaborately designed, which is learned under the supervision of an uncertainty loss to balance the optimization of different predictors in a region-adaptive manner. Besides this, a replay buffer mechanism is introduced to improve medium-range forecast performance. With 39-year data training based on the ERA5 reanalysis, FengWu is able to accurately reproduce the atmospheric dynamics and predict the future land and atmosphere states at 37 vertical levels on a 0.25{\\deg} latitude-longitude resolution. Hindcasts of 6-hourly weather in 2018 based on ERA5 demonstrate that FengWu performs better than GraphCast in predicting 80\\% of the 880 reported predictands, e.g., reducing the root mean square error (RMSE) of 10-day lead global z500 prediction from 733 to 651 $m^{2}/s^2$.

PS documents may be used to conceal the artifacts of images which is due to the synthetic nature of images since these artifacts are typically present in manipulated images and the main artifacts in the synthetic images can be removed after the PS. Due to the appeal of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), synthetic face images generated with GANs models are difficult to differentiate from genuine human faces and may be used to create counterfeit identities. Additionally, since GANs models do not account for physiological constraints for generating human faces and their impact on human IRISes, distinguishing genuine from synthetic IRISes in the PS scenario becomes extremely difficult. As a result of the lack of large-scale reference IRIS datasets in the PS scenario, we aim at developing a novel dataset to become a standard for Multimedia Forensics (MFs) investigation which is available at [45].

To fill the missing pixels of extracted iris, we applied techniques to discover the complex link between the iris images.

To address these challenges, first, we associate safety signals with state-action trajectories (rather than just an immediate state-action). This makes our safety model highly general. We also assume categorical safety labels are given for different trajectories, rather than a numerical cost function, which is harder to specify by the problem designer.

However, confusing human-like objects often lead to wrong detections, and small scale or heavily occluded pedestrians are easily missed due to their unusual appearances. To address these challenges, only object regions are inadequate, thus how to fully utilize more explicit and semantic contexts becomes a key problem. Meanwhile, previous context-aware pedestrian detectors either only learn latent contexts with visual clues, or need laborious annotations to obtain explicit and semantic contexts. Therefore, we propose in this paper a novel approach via Vision-Language semantic self-supervision for context-aware Pedestrian Detection (VLPD) to model explicitly semantic contexts without any extra annotations. Firstly, we propose a self-supervised Vision-Language Semantic (VLS) segmentation method, which learns both fully-supervised pedestrian detection and contextual segmentation via self-generated explicit labels of semantic classes by vision-language models. Furthermore, a self-supervised Prototypical Semantic Contrastive (PSC) learning method is proposed to better discriminate pedestrians and other classes, based on more explicit and semantic contexts obtained from VLS.

This involves assessing the accuracy of VQA models under increasing levels of noise in the input, which can target either the image or the proposed query question, dubbed the main question. However, there is currently a lack of proper analysis of this aspect of VQA. This work proposes a new method that utilizes semantically related questions, referred to as basic questions, acting as noise to evaluate the robustness of VQA models. It is hypothesized that as the similarity of a basic question to the main question decreases, the level of noise increases. To generate a reasonable noise level for a given main question, a pool of basic questions is ranked based on their similarity to the main question, and this ranking problem is cast as a LASSO optimization problem. Additionally, this work proposes a novel robustness measure, R_score, and two basic question datasets to standardize the analysis of VQA model robustness. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed evaluation method effectively analyzes the robustness of VQA models.

For example, training GPT-3 in Microsoft's state-of-the-art U.S. data centers can directly consume 700,000 liters of clean freshwater (enough for producing 370 BMW cars or 320 Tesla electric vehicles) and the water consumption would have been tripled if training were done in Microsoft's Asian data centers, but such information has been kept as a secret. This is extremely concerning, as freshwater scarcity has become one of the most pressing challenges shared by all of us in the wake of the rapidly growing population, depleting water resources, and aging water infrastructures. To respond to the global water challenges, AI models can, and also should, take social responsibility and lead by example by addressing their own water footprint. In this paper, we provide a principled methodology to estimate fine-grained water footprint of AI models, and also discuss the unique spatial-temporal diversities of AI models' runtime water efficiency. Finally, we highlight the necessity of holistically addressing water footprint along with carbon footprint to enable truly sustainable AI.","creator":"Pengfei Li, Jianyi Yang, Mohammad A.

However, most existing motion mimicking methods are built upon reinforcement learning (RL) and suffer from heavy reward engineering, high variance, and slow convergence with hard explorations. Specifically, they usually take tens of hours or even days of training to mimic a simple motion sequence, resulting in poor scalability. In this work, we leverage differentiable physics simulators (DPS) and propose an efficient motion mimicking method dubbed DiffMimic. Our key insight is that DPS casts a complex policy learning task to a much simpler state matching problem. In particular, DPS learns a stable policy by analytical gradients with ground-truth physical priors hence leading to significantly faster and stabler convergence than RL-based methods. Moreover, to escape from local optima, we utilize a Demonstration Replay mechanism to enable stable gradient backpropagation in a long horizon. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks show that DiffMimic has a better sample efficiency and time efficiency than existing methods (e.g., DeepMimic). Notably, DiffMimic allows a physically simulated character to learn Backflip after 10 minutes of training and be able to cycle it after 3 hours of training, while the existing approach may require about a day of training to cycle Backflip. More importantly, we hope DiffMimic can benefit more differentiable animation systems with techniques like differentiable clothes simulation in future research.","creator":"Jiawei Ren, Cunjun Yu, Siwei Chen, Xiao Ma, Liang Pan, Ziwei Liu"},{"title":"Instruction Tuning with GPT-4.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03277","abstract":"Prior work has shown that finetuning large language models (LLMs) using machine-generated instruction-following data enables such models to achieve remarkable zero-shot capabilities on new tasks, and no human-written instructions are needed.

They are hard to control, however, due to high dimensionality, complex dynamics, and a coupled architecture. Physics-based simulation is a promising avenue for developing locomotion policies that can be transferred to real robots. Nevertheless, modeling tensegrity robots is a complex task due to a substantial sim2real gap. To address this issue, this paper describes a Real2Sim2Real (R2S2R) strategy for tensegrity robots. This strategy is based on a differentiable physics engine that can be trained given limited data from a real robot. These data include offline measurements of physical properties, such as mass and geometry for various robot components, and the observation of a trajectory using a random control policy. With the data from the real robot, the engine can be iteratively refined and used to discover locomotion policies that are directly transferable to the real robot. Beyond the R2S2R pipeline, key contributions of this work include computing non-zero gradients at contact points, a loss function for matching tensegrity locomotion gaits, and a trajectory segmentation technique that avoids conflicts in gradient evaluation during training. Multiple iterations of the R2S2R process are demonstrated and evaluated on a real 3-bar tensegrity robot.","creator":"Kun Wang, William R.

We desire to build informative representations without using supervised (labelled) data. One of the possible approaches is self-supervised learning (SSL). In contrast to the supervised paradigm, this one requires little or no labels for the data. Nowadays, most SSL approaches are either contrastive or non-contrastive. Contrastive methods make representations of similar (positive) objects closer and distancing different (negative) ones. Due to possible wrong marking of positive and negative pairs, these methods can provide an inferior performance. Non-contrastive methods don't rely on such labelling and are widespread in computer vision. They learn using only pairs of similar objects that are easier to identify in logging data.

Test oracles rely on a ground-truth that can distinguish between the correct and buggy behavior to determine whether a test fails (detects a bug) or passes. What makes the oracle problem challenging and undecidable is the assumption that the ground-truth should know the exact expected, correct, or buggy behavior. However, we argue that one can still build an accurate oracle without knowing the exact correct or buggy behavior, but how these two might differ. This paper presents SEER, a learning-based approach that in the absence of test assertions or other types of oracle, can determine whether a unit test passes or fails on a given method under test (MUT). To build the ground-truth, SEER jointly embeds unit tests and the implementation of MUTs into a unified vector space, in such a way that the neural representation of tests are similar to that of MUTs they pass on them, but dissimilar to MUTs they fail on them. The classifier built on top of this vector representation serves as the oracle to generate \"fail\" labels, when test inputs detect a bug in MUT or \"pass\" labels, otherwise. Our extensive experiments on applying SEER to more than 5K unit tests from a diverse set of open-source Java projects show that the produced oracle is (1) effective in predicting the fail or pass labels, achieving an overall accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 measure of 93%, 86%, 94%, and 90%, (2) generalizable, predicting the labels for the unit test of projects that were not in training or validation set with negligible performance drop, and (3) efficient, detecting the existence of bugs in only 6.5 milliseconds on average.","creator":"Ali Reza Ibrahimzada, Yigit Varli, Dilara Tekinoglu, Reyhaneh Jabbarvand"},{"title":"Data Mesh: Motivational Factors, Challenges, and Best Practices.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.01713","abstract":"With the increasing importance of data and artificial intelligence, organizations strive to become more data-driven.

However, more efficient forecasting can still be achieved by following two main routes; enlarging the scale of the transportation graph, and simultaneously exploiting different types of nodes and edges in the graphs. However, both approaches are challenged by the scalability of GNNs. An immediate remedy to the scalability challenge is to decentralize the GNN operation.

With these, we develop IPMAN, to estimate a 3D body from a color image in a \"stable\" configuration by encouraging plausible floor contact and overlapping CoP and CoM. Our IP terms are intuitive, easy to implement, fast to compute, differentiable, and can be integrated into existing optimization and regression methods. We evaluate IPMAN on standard datasets and MoYo, a new dataset with synchronized multi-view images, ground-truth 3D bodies with complex poses, body-floor contact, CoM and pressure. IPMAN produces more plausible results than the state of the art, improving accuracy for static poses, while not hurting dynamic ones.

In order to assess how well these new approaches behave on a set of common challenges often faced in real-world data, we hosted a competition at the 2022 Genetic and Evolutionary Computation Conference consisting of different synthetic and real-world datasets which were blind to entrants.

In this work, we present POLAR-Express, an efficient and precise formal reachability analysis tool for verifying the safety of NNCSs. POLAR-Express uses Taylor model arithmetic to propagate Taylor models (TMs) across a neural network layer-by-layer to compute an overapproximation of the neural-network function. It can be applied to analyze any feed-forward neural network with continuous activation functions. We also present a novel approach to propagate TMs more efficiently and precisely across ReLU activation functions. In addition, POLAR-Express provides parallel computation support for the layer-by-layer propagation of TMs, thus significantly improving the efficiency and scalability over its earlier prototype POLAR.

However, existing efforts perform the mask-then-reconstruct operation in the raw data space as is done in computer vision (CV) and natural language processing (NLP) areas, while neglecting the important non-Euclidean property of graph data. As a result, the highly unstable local connection structures largely increase the uncertainty in inferring masked data and decrease the reliability of the exploited self-supervision signals, leading to inferior representations for downstream evaluations. To address this issue, we propose a novel SGP method termed Robust mAsked gRaph autoEncoder (RARE) to improve the certainty in inferring masked data and the reliability of the self-supervision mechanism by further masking and reconstructing node samples in the high-order latent feature space. Through both theoretical and empirical analyses, we have discovered that performing a joint mask-then-reconstruct strategy in both latent feature and raw data spaces could yield improved stability and performance. To this end, we elaborately design a masked latent feature completion scheme, which predicts latent features of masked nodes under the guidance of high-order sample correlations that are hard to be observed from the raw data perspective. Specifically, we first adopt a latent feature predictor to predict the masked latent features from the visible ones. Next, we encode the raw data of masked samples with a momentum graph encoder and subsequently employ the resulting representations to improve predicted results through latent feature matching. Extensive experiments on seventeen datasets have demonstrated the effectiveness and robustness of RARE against state-of-the-art (SOTA) competitors across three downstream tasks.","creator":"Wenxuan Tu, Qing Liao, Sihang Zhou, Xin Peng, Chuan Ma, Zhe Liu, Xinwang Liu, Zhiping Cai"},{"title":"MEnsA: Mix-up Ensemble Average for Unsupervised Multi Target Domain Adaptation on 3D Point Clouds.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01554","abstract":"Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) addresses the problem of distribution shift between the unlabelled target domain and labelled source domain.

However, most of them assume that students' historical interactions are uniformly distributed in a continuous sequence, ignoring the fact that actual interaction sequences are organized based on a series of quizzes with clear boundaries, where interactions within a quiz are consecutively completed, but interactions across different quizzes are discrete and may be spaced over days. In this paper, we present the Quiz-based Knowledge Tracing (QKT) model to monitor students' knowledge states according to their quiz-based learning interactions. Specifically, as students' interactions within a quiz are continuous and have the same or similar knowledge concepts, we design the adjacent gate followed by a global average pooling layer to capture the intra-quiz short-term knowledge influence. Then, as various quizzes tend to focus on different knowledge concepts, we respectively measure the inter-quiz knowledge substitution by the gated recurrent unit and the inter-quiz knowledge complementarity by the self-attentive encoder with a novel recency-aware attention mechanism. Finally, we integrate the inter-quiz long-term knowledge substitution and complementarity across different quizzes to output students' evolving knowledge states. Extensive experimental results on three public real-world datasets demonstrate that QKT achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to existing methods.

During embryogenesis, the CHH methylation landscape is dramatically reprogrammed, resulting in exceedingly high levels of this modification upon mature embryo formation. The mechanisms constituting the remodeling process, and its function in embryos, are unclear. Here, we isolate embryos from Arabidopsis plants harboring mutations for key components of the pathways that confer CHH methylation, namely RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM) and the Chromomethylase 2 (CMT2) pathways. We reveal that embryos are more methylated than leaves at shared CMT2 and RdDM targeting loci, accounting for most embryonic CHH hypermethylation. While the majority of embryo CHH methylated loci overlap with those in somatic tissues, a subset of conventional pericentric CMT2-methylated loci are instead targeted by RdDM in embryos. These loci, termed embRdDM exhibit intermediate H3K9me2 levels, associated with increased chromatin accessibility. Strikingly, more than 50% of the embRdDM loci in pollen vegetative (nurse) cells and ddm1 mutant somatic tissues are also targeted by RdDM, and these tissues were also reported to exhibit increased chromatin accessibility in pericentric heterochromatin. Furthermore, the root columella stem cell niche also displays CHH hypermethylation and an enriched presence of small RNAs at embRdDM loci. Finally, we observe a significant overlap of CHH hypermethylated loci with endosperm DEMETER targeting sites, suggesting that non-cell autonomous communication within the seed may contribute to the epigenetic landscape of the embryo. However, similar overlap with vegetative cell DEMETER targets indicates that the chromatin landscape that allows DEMETER access is mirrored in developing embryos, permitting CHH methylation catalysis at the same loci. Our findings demonstrate that both conserved and embryo-specific epigenetic mechanisms reshape CHH methylation profiles in the dynamic chromatin environment of embryogenesis.","creator":"Hsieh, P.-H., Frost, J.

We also included chlorophyte algae and early-diverging land plants as outgroups. Free auxin, tRNA-derived cytokinins and certain phenolics including salicylic acid were found ubiquitously. However, land plants differed from green algae by the consistent detection of abscisic acid and the presence of auxin and cytokinin conjugates and trans-zeatin, supporting the hypotheses that these three phytohormones likely came to regulate development in the ancestral land plant.

We additionaly analyzed the corresponding culture and empty media to account for phytohormone excretion and environmental contamination. Extracellular auxins and cytokinins were frequently detected, while agar constituted a major external source of phenolic compounds.

Our genome-wide approach and 3D structure comparison showed that the Arabidopsis SWEET8 homolog in pineapple, AcSWEET10, shares similar sequences and protein properties responsible for glucose transport. To determine the functional conservation of AcSWEET10, we tested its ability to complement glucose transport mutants in yeast and analyzed its expression in stamens and impact on the microspore phenotype and seed set in transgenic Arabidopsis.

Moreover, the method has (iii) a high spatial resolution that allows identification of solute-microdomains in the leaf apoplast. The method was established for Arabidopsis thaliana and Vicia faba leaves but should also be applicable to other plants species with similar leaf morphologies. It is based on the infiltration of an aqueous extraction solution into the apoplast followed by its recovery seconds later, both through the stomata. By this, the apoplast (and its solutes) of an identical leaf can be sampled on successive days with negligible symplastic contamination. A spatiotemporal mapping of leaf apoplastic ion and metabolite patterns within the identical leaf opens a window of opportunity for understanding apoplast biology. As for example, the existence of apoplastic abscisic acid gradients within a leaf in response to salinity was witnessed in this study, as was the unsuspected accumulation of kaempferol glycosides in the leaf apoplast.

Vessel elements, the water transporting units within woody tissues, are generated from a cylindrical domain of cambium stem cells (CSCs) producing different vascular cell types in a bidirectional manner. However, knowledge on the regulation of CSC activity is limited with unclear cell fate trajectories as the most obscure aspect in this context. Here, via revealing transcriptome signatures of CSCs and their derivatives with single cell resolution in Arabidopsis thaliana, we discover that the strigolactone (SL) signalling pathway modulates cell type composition in vascular tissues and thereby increases drought resistance. In particular, we find that SL signalling negatively regulates vessel element formation and thereby plant water usage. SL signalling is generally associated with differentiating vascular tissues but low in developing vessels and in CSCs implying a local role during fate decisions in CSC-derived cells. Highlighting the importance of vascular tissue composition for the overall plant water balance, alteration of vessel element formation has a direct impact on transpiration rates through leaf stomata. Our results demonstrate the importance of structural alignment of water transporting tissues to unstable water regimes and provide perspectives for a long-term modulation of drought resistance in plants.","creator":"Zhao, J., Shi, D., Kaeufer, K., Song, C., Xu, X., Luzzietti, L., Bennett, T., Kaufmann, K., Greb, T."},{"title":"A single amino acid substitution in MdLAZY1A dominantly impairs shoot gravitropism in Malus","link":"http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2023.04.05.535771v1?rss=1","abstract":"Plant architecture is one of the most important factors that determines crop yield potential and productivity.

We report the identification of MdLAZY1A (MD13G1122400) as the genetic determinant underpinning the Weeping (W) locus that largely controls weeping growth in Malus. MdLAZY1A is one of the four paralogs in apple that are most closely related to AtLAZY1 involved in gravitropism in Arabidopsis. The weeping allele (MdLAZY1A-W) contains a single nucleotide mutation c.584T>C that leads to a leucine to proline (L195P) substitution within a predicted transmembrane domain that co-localizes with Region III, one of the five conserved regions in LAZY1-like proteins.

Over-expressing the weeping allele in apple cultivar Royal Gala (RG) with standard growth habit impaired its gravitropic response and altered the growth to weeping-like. Suppressing the standard allele (MdLAZY1A-S) by RNA interference (RNAi) in RG similarly changed the branch growth direction to downward. Overall, the L195P mutation in MdLAZY1A is genetically causal for weeping growth, underscoring not only the crucial roles of residue L195 and Region III in MdLAZY1A-mediated gravitropic response, but also a potential DNA base editing target for tree architecture improvement in Malus and other crops.","creator":"Dougherty, L., Borejsza-Wysocka, E., Miaule, A., Wang, P., Zheng, D., Jansen, M., BROWN, S.

However, LDs may be also degraded via lipophagy, a type of selective autophagy, which mediates LDs delivery to vacuoles or lysosomes. The exact mechanism of this process in plants still remains unresolved. Here, we provide evidence that during Arabidopsis thaliana seed germination, LDs are degraded by microlipophagy and that this process requires caleosin 1 (CLO1), a LD surface protein. We show co-localization of autophagy-related protein 8b (ATG8b) and LDs during seed germination and localization of lipidated ATG8 (ATG8-PE) to the LD fraction. We further demonstrate that CLO1, CLO2 and CLO3 interact with ATG8 proteins via their ATG8-interacting motifs (AIMs). Deletion of AIM localized directly before the proline knot disrupts CLO1 interaction with ATG8b, suggesting the essential role of this region in the interaction between the two proteins.

This study demonstrates the power of artificial intelligence to accurately predict novel cross-kingdom interactions at the plant-pathogen interface.","creator":"Homma, F., Huang, J., van der Hoorn, R.

Insect salivary proteins have been suggested to be essential for successful viral infection, but their exact mechanisms are largely unknown. In this study, we reveal that salivary factors from Laodelphax striatellus are necessary for infection of Rice stripe virus (RSV) in plants. A salivary carbonic anhydrase (LssaCA) is identified as an essential factor in promoting RSV infection. LssaCA interacts with a rice thaumatin-like protein (OsTLP) that has endo-{beta}-1,3-glucanase activity and can degrade callose in plants. RSV infection induces callose deposition, which can be reversed by LssaCA. Furthermore, LssaCA directly binds to the RSV nucleocapsid protein (NP) in salivary glands, and the LssaCA-RSV NP complex still binds OsTLP and further increases its glucanase activity. This study provides new insights into the tripartite virus-insect vector-plant interaction, which is relevant to many agriculturally important plant arboviruses whose transmission is facilitated by insect salivary proteins.","creator":"Zhao, J., Yang, J., Meng, X., Fang, R., Huo, Y., Zhang, L."},{"title":"Lectins in pistils play a key role in self-incompatibility in the heterostylous Linum perenne","link":"http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2023.04.02.535286v1?rss=1","abstract":"Self-incompatibility is one of the mechanisms preventing inbreeding in populations, based on the failure of pollen grains to germinate or of pollen tubes to grow normally in incompatible crosses. A unique model for studying this process are heterostylous species, in which self-incompatibility alleles are closely linked to flower morphological traits. One such species is L. perenne, a classic distylous species with reciprocal herkogamy and complete self-incompatibility strongly linked. The mechanism of self-pollen recognition is poorly understood in most heterostylous species, including L. perenne. As self-incompatibility in other systems is based on protein-protein interactions and many extracellular proteins are glycosylated, one of the possible participants in this process may be lectins. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the lectin activity in pistils and stamens of L. perenne L-morph and S-morph plants and to establish whether these lectins take part in self-incompatibility. We show that pistil-derived galactose-specific Ca2+-independent lectins from the respective other morph can overcome self-incompatibility in heterostylous L. perenne. This may be due to the presence of some lectins that are specific for arabinose and xylose. Our results suggest that lectins participate in signaling pathways for recognition at the pollen-stigma interface and are involved in the regulation of the self-incompatibility process in L. perenne.","creator":"Levchuk, H., Makhno, Y., Costa, M.

SLs are structurally diverse, divided into a canonical and a non-canonical sub-family. To better understand the biological function of particular SLs, we generated CRISPR/Cas9 mutants disrupted in OsMAX1-1400 or OsMAX1-1900, which encode cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYP711A clade) contributing to SL diversity. The disruption of OsMAX1-1900 did neither affect the SL pattern nor plant architecture, indicating a functional redundancy. In contrast, disruption of OsMAX1-1400 activity, a 4-deoxyorobanchol hydroxylase, led to a complete lack of orobanchol and an accumulation of its precursor 4-deoxyorobanchol (4DO), both of which are a canonical SLs common in different plant species, accompanied by higher levels of the non-canonical methyl 4-oxo-carlactonoate (4-oxo-MeCLA). Os1400 mutants showed also shorter plant height, panicle and panicle base length, but did not exhibit a tillering phenotype. Hormone quantification and transcriptome analysis revealed elevated auxin levels and changes in the expression of auxin-related, as well as of SL biosynthetic genes. Interestingly, the Os900/1400 double mutant lacking both orobanchol and 4DO did not show the observed Os1400 architectural phenotypes, indicating that they are a result of 4DO accumulation. A comparison of the mycorrhization and Striga seed germinating activity of Os900, Os900/1400, and Os1400 loss-of-function mutants demonstrates that the germination activity positively correlates with 4DO content while disrupting OsMAX1-1400 negatively impact mycorrhizal symbiosis. Taken together, our paper deciphers the biological function of canonical SLs in rice and depicts their particular contributions to establishing architecture and rhizospheric communications.","creator":"Chen, G.-T.

Here, we reveal amyloplast structure plays an important role in starch granule morphogenesis in wheat endosperm. Wheat amyloplasts contain large discoid A-type granules and small spherical B-type granules. We isolated a mutant in durum wheat defective in the plastid division protein PARC6, which had increased plastid size in both leaves and endosperm. Endosperm amyloplasts of the mutant contained more A- and B-type granules than those of the wild type. In mature grains, the mutant had larger A- and B-type granules than the wild type, and its A-type granules had a highly aberrant, lobed surface. This defect in granule morphology was already evident at early stages of grain development, when granule size was identical between the mutant and the wild type, and occurred without obvious alterations in starch polymer structure and composition. Plant growth and photosynthetic efficiency, as well as the size, number and starch content of grains, were not affected in the Ttparc6 mutants despite the large changes in plastid size. Interestingly, mutation of the PARC6 paralog, ARC6, in durum wheat did not increase plastid or starch granule size. We suggest this is because TtPARC6 can complement disrupted TtARC6 function by interacting with PDV2, the outer plastid envelope protein that typically interacts with ARC6 to promote plastid division. We propose that amyloplast compartment size and available stromal volume play important roles in determining starch granule size, shape and number per amyloplast.","creator":"Esch, L., Ngai, Q.

However, it is crucial to understand the biology of these viruses to evaluate the risks they pose for the production of crops and natural ecosystems and to manage them properly. In 2018, Physostegia chlorotic mottle virus (PhCMoV) was detected in Austria in a Physostegia plant (Lamiaceae) using HTS, and subsequent prepublication data sharing associated the presence of the virus with severe fruit symptoms on important crops like tomato, eggplant, and cucumber across nine European countries. This discovery led to a collaborative effort to understand better the virus's genetic diversity, host range, symptomatology, and distribution. Still, specific knowledge gaps remained. In this study, the authors address these gaps by examining the transmission mode, prevalence, and disease severity of PhCMoV. Bioassay and field survey confirmed the causal association between the presence of the virus and symptoms on tomato and eggplant. The investigation also mapped out the historical and geographic footprint of the virus, spanning back 30 years and including a new location, Switzerland. Based on field survey, PhCMoV was found to naturally infect 11 new host plant species across seven families, extending the host range of PhCMoV to 20 plant species across 14 plant families. Greenhouse assays with mechanical inoculation showed that yield losses could reach 100% depending on the phenological stage of the plant at the time of infection. The study also identified a polyphagous leafhopper species (Anaceratagallia sp.) as the natural vector of PhCMoV. PhCMoV was widespread in diversified vegetable farms in Belgium where tomato is grown in soil, occurring in approximately one-third of such farms. However, outbreaks were sporadic and it can be suggested that they were associated with specific cultural practices, such as the cultivation of perennial plants in tomato tunnels that can serve as a host for both the virus and its vector. To further explore this phenomenon and better manage the virus, studying the ecology of the Anaceratagalliae vector would be beneficial.","creator":"Temple, C., Blouin, A.

Mutant alleles of the transmembrane receptor kinase INFLORESCENCE AND ROOT APICES RECEPTOR KINASE (IRK) exhibit excess endodermal cell divisions, resulting in more cells in the radial axis of irk roots. IRK localizes to the outer polar domain of endodermal cells, which suggests directional signal perception is necessary to repress endodermal cell proliferation. Here, we conducted a detailed examination of endodermal cell divisions in irk and identified a distinct cell division orientation defect. Many excess endodermal divisions in irk-4 have outwardly skewed division planes, therefore we termed them  radial askew divisions. An IRK truncation lacking the kinase domain retains polar localization and rescues these radial askew divisions, but exhibits excess periclinal divisions, phenocopying the weaker irk-1 allele. These results expand IRKs function beyond repression of endodermal cell division activity showing its also required for division plane orientation. Based on its polarity, we propose that IRK at the outer lateral endodermal cell face interferes with division plane selection, maintenance, and/or cell plate attachment to influence endodermal cell division orientation.","creator":"Rony, R.

In their later development, lateral branches maintain gravitropic setpoint angles (GSAs) in which growth is set and maintained relative to gravity. The typically non-vertical GSAs are the product of an auxindependent antigravitropic offset that counteracts underlying gravitropic response in the branch (Roychoudhry et al., 2013). Here we describe an earlier phase of branch development in which the young lateral shoot grows rootward, independently of gravity, promoting a spreading growth habit. In normal development, this phase of growth is terminated with the onset of the GSA programme, with branches then growing upwards to assume their mature form. The biophysical basis of the early rootward phase of branch growth can be traced back to greater cell proliferation on the upper, adaxial side that upon expansion, drives asymmetric growth. Our data indicate that cytokinin is involved in this process and that the transcription factor TCP1 is an important regulator of lateral shoot adaxial identity and differential ad-abaxial cell proliferation.","creator":"De Angelis, M., Kepinski, S."},{"title":"Changes in Protein Turn-over Rates Regulate Tryptophan and Glucosinolate Biosynthesis, IAA Transport and Photosynthesis in Arabidopsis Growth and Defense Transitions","link":"http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2023.03.31.535076v1?rss=1","abstract":"An organism continuously experiences shifts in biological states necessitating extensive rearrangement of physiology and molecular order of the cell.

Temporally changing synthesis and degradation rates were primary determinants of abundance, next to changes in mRNA levels, of tryptophan, glucosinolate (GS) biosynthesis and photosynthesis associated (PAP) proteins particularly in the earlier establisher phases but also in fully induced PTI. While transcripts returned to growth levels 3 to 16 hours post elicitation, protein levels remained at fully induced PTI levels up to 16 hours into the transitory phase back to optimal growth. A notable exception were polar auxin transporters PIN3 and PIN7 levels which decreased in PTI but quickly returned to initial homeostasis levels after transition, although global auxin levels only decreased by 20%. Tryptophan, GS and JA biosynthesis proteins all increased in abundance in the wild type and the myc234 mutant background linking induction of the tryptophan and GS biosynthesis pathways to flg22 treatment and PTI independent of MYC2 and homologs. PAPs abundance was depleted in fully induced PTI however not in the myc234 mutant linking this active immune response to these bHLH transcription factors. FERREDOXIN-NADP(+)-OXIDOREDUCTASE (FNR1) synthesis rates decreased while its degradation rate increased in the earlier PTI establisher phase. FNR1 is the penultimate protein in the photosynthetic electron transfer chain and imparts electrons onto NADP+ however in its absence electrons are used for oxygen photoreduction and H2O2 production, an active defense compound. Thus FNR1 may be a molecular switch that switches photosystem activity between growth and defense under post-transcriptional control. The myc234 mutation generally led to delayed changes in transcript and protein abundance and also abolished IAA depletion. Protein turn-over rates of a set of PAPs were affected in the mutant suggesting a possible positive role of the transcription factors in controlling post-transcriptional regulatory processes in PTI induction.","creator":"Abukhalaf, M., Proksch, C., Thieme, D., Ziegler, J., Hoehenwarter, W."},{"title":"Ensemble of BLUP, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning Models Predict Maize Yield Better Than Each Model Alone.","link":"http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2023.03.30.532932v1?rss=1","abstract":"Predicting phenotypes accurately from genomic, environment, and management factors is key to accelerating the development of novel cultivars with desirable traits.

In eukaryotes, the limiting step in de novo dNTP synthesis is catalyzed by RIBONUCLEOTIDE REDUCTASE (RNR), which consists of two R1 and two R2 subunits. In Arabidopsis, RNR1 is encoded by CRINKLED LEAVES 8 (CLS8) and RNR2 by three paralogous genes, including TSO2 (TSO MEANING UGLY IN CHINESE 2).

We also uncover positive sorting for single men and negative sorting for married women that accounts for a substantive fraction of the gender wage gap at the top of the distribution.","creator":"Victor Chernozhukov, Iv&#xe1;n Fern&#xe1;ndez-Val, Siyi Luo"},{"title":"Functional Principal Component Analysis for Cointegrated Functional Time Series.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2011.12781","abstract":"Functional principal component analysis (FPCA) has played an important role in the development of functional time series analysis. This note investigates how FPCA can be used to analyze cointegrated functional time series and proposes a modification of FPCA as a novel statistical tool. Our modified FPCA not only provides an asymptotically more efficient estimator of the cointegrating vectors, but also leads to novel FPCA-based tests for examining essential properties of cointegrated functional time series.","creator":"Won-Ki Seo"},{"title":"Sharp Bounds in the Latent Index Selection Model.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2012.02390","abstract":"A fundamental question underlying the literature on partial identification is: what can we learn about parameters that are relevant for policy but not necessarily point-identified by the exogenous variation we observe? This paper provides an answer in terms of sharp, analytic characterizations and bounds for an important class of policy-relevant treatment effects, consisting of marginal treatment effects and linear functionals thereof, in the latent index selection model as formalized in Vytlacil (2002). The sharp bounds use the full content of identified marginal distributions, and analytic derivations rely on the theory of stochastic orders. The proposed methods also make it possible to sharply incorporate new auxiliary assumptions on distributions into the latent index selection framework. Empirically, I apply the methods to study the effects of Medicaid on emergency room utilization in the Oregon Health Insurance Experiment, showing that the predictions from extrapolations based on a distribution assumption (rank similarity) differ substantively and consistently from existing extrapolations based on a parametric mean assumption (linearity). This underscores the value of utilizing the model's full empirical content in combination with auxiliary assumptions.","creator":"Philip Marx"},{"title":"Treatment Choice with Nonlinear Regret.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2205.08586","abstract":"The literature focuses on minimizing the mean of welfare regret, which can lead to undesirable treatment choice due to sampling uncertainty. We propose to minimize the mean of a nonlinear transformation of regret and show that admissible rules are fractional for nonlinear regret. Focusing on mean square regret, we derive closed-form fractions for finite-sample Bayes and minimax optimal rules. Our approach is grounded in decision theory and extends to limit experiments. The treatment fractions can be viewed as the strength of evidence favoring treatment. We apply our framework to a normal regression model and sample size calculations in randomized experiments.","creator":"Toru Kitagawa, Sokbae Lee, Chen Qiu"},{"title":"Prolonged Learning and Hasty Stopping: the Wald Problem with Ambiguity.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.14121","abstract":"This paper studies sequential information acquisition by an ambiguity-averse decision maker (DM), who decides how long to collect information before taking an irreversible action. The agent optimizes against the worst-case belief and updates prior by prior. We show that the consideration of ambiguity gives rise to rich dynamics: compared to the Bayesian DM, the DM here tends to experiment excessively when facing modest uncertainty and, to counteract it, may stop experimenting prematurely when facing high uncertainty. In the latter case, the DM's stopping rule is non-monotonic in beliefs and features randomized stopping.","creator":"Sarah Auster, Yeon-Koo Che, Konrad Mierendorff"}]}]
