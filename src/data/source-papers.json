While their utility is widely recognized, challenges persist in their automation and completeness. Despite efforts in automation and the utilization of expert-created ontologies, gaps in connectivity remain prevalent within KGs. In response to these challenges, we propose an innovative approach termed ``Medical Knowledge Graph Automation (M-KGA)\". M-KGA leverages user-provided medical concepts and enriches them semantically using BioPortal ontologies, thereby enhancing the completeness of knowledge graphs through the integration of pre-trained embeddings. Our approach introduces two distinct methodologies for uncovering hidden connections within the knowledge graph: a cluster-based approach and a node-based approach. Through rigorous testing involving 100 frequently occurring medical concepts in Electronic Health Records (EHRs), our M-KGA framework demonstrates promising results, indicating its potential to address the limitations of existing knowledge graph automation techniques.","creator":"Mutahira Khalid, Raihana Rahman, Asim Abbas, Sushama Kumari, Iram Wajahat, Syed Ahmad Chan Bukhari"},{"id":"2405.02324","slug":"combined-compromise-for-ideal-solution-cocofiso-a-multi-criteria-decision-making-based-on-the-cocoso-method-algorithm","title":"Combined Compromise for Ideal Solution (CoCoFISo): a multi-criteria decision-making based on the CoCoSo method algorithm","link":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02324","abstract":"Abstract: Each decision-making tool should be tested and validated in real case studies to be practical and fit to global problems. The application of multi-criteria decision-making methods (MCDM) is currently a trend to rank alternatives. In the literature, there are several multi-criteria decision-making methods according to their classification. During our experimentation on the Combined Compromise Solution (CoCoSo) method, we encountered its limits for real cases. The authors examined the applicability of the CoCoFISo method (improved version of combined compromise solution), by a real case study in a university campus and compared the obtained results to other MCDMs such as Preference Ranking Organisation Method for Enrichment Evaluations (PROMETHEE), Weighted Sum Method (WSM) and Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to the Ideal Solution (TOPSIS). Our research finding indicates that CoCoSo is an applied method that has been developed to solve complex multi variable assessment problems, while CoCoFISo can improve the shortages observed in CoCoSo and deliver stable outcomes compared to other developed tools. The findings imply that application of CoCoFISo is suggested to decision makers, experts and researchers while they are facing practical challenges and sensitive questions regarding the utilization of a reliable decision-making method. Unlike many prior studies, the current version of CoCoSo is unique, original and is presented for the first time. Its performance was approved using several strategies and examinations.","creator":"R\\^olin Gabriel Rasoanaivo (IRIT, UT Capitole, IRIT-ADRIA), Morteza Yazdani (UIV), Pascale Zarat\\'e (IRIT, UT Capitole, IRIT-ADRIA), Amirhossein Fateh (UPV)"},{"id":"2405.02325","slug":"meat-meets-machine-multiscale-competency-enables-causal-learning","title":"Meat Meets Machine! Multiscale Competency Enables Causal Learning","link":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02325","abstract":"Abstract: Biological intelligence uses a \"multiscale competency architecture\" (MCA). It exhibits adaptive, goal directed behaviour at all scales, from cells to organs to organisms. In contrast, machine intelligence is only adaptive and goal directed at a high level. Learned policies are passively interpreted using abstractions (e.g. arithmetic) embodied in static interpreters (e.g. x86). Biological intelligence excels at causal learning. Machine intelligence does not. Previous work showed causal learning follows from weak policy optimisation, which is hindered by presupposed abstractions in silico. Here we formalise MCAs as nested \"agentic abstraction layers\", to understand how they might learn causes. We show that weak policy optimisation at low levels enables weak policy optimisation at high. This facilitates what we call \"multiscale causal learning\" and high level goal directed behaviour. We argue that by engineering human abstractions in silico we disconnect high level goal directed behaviour from the low level goal directed behaviour that gave rise to it. This inhibits causal learning, and we speculate this is one reason why human recall would be accompanied by feeling, and in silico recall not.","creator":"Michael Timothy Bennett"},{"id":"2405.02327","slug":"causaldisco-causal-discovery-using-knowledge-graph-link-prediction","title":"CausalDisco: Causal discovery using knowledge graph link prediction","link":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02327","abstract":"Abstract: Causal discovery is a process of discovering new causal relations from observational data. Traditional causal discovery methods often suffer from issues related to missing data To address these issues, this paper presents a novel approach called CausalDisco that formulates causal discovery as a knowledge graph completion problem. More specifically, the task of discovering causal relations is mapped to the task of knowledge graph link prediction. CausalDisco supports two types of discovery: causal explanation and causal prediction. The causal relations have weights representing the strength of the causal association between entities in the knowledge graph. An evaluation of this approach uses a benchmark dataset of simulated videos for causal reasoning, CLEVRER-Humans, and compares the performance of multiple knowledge graph embedding algorithms. In addition, two distinct dataset splitting approaches are utilized within the evaluation: (1) random-based split, which is the method typically used to evaluate link prediction algorithms, and (2) Markov-based split, a novel data split technique for evaluating link prediction that utilizes the Markovian property of the causal relation. Results show that using weighted causal relations improves causal discovery over the baseline without weighted relations.","creator":"Utkarshani Jaimini, Cory Henson, Amit P.

While artificial intelligence (AI)-native networks promise to overcome some limitations of wireless technologies, developments still rely on AI tools like neural networks. Such tools struggle to cope with the non-trivial challenges of the network environment and the growing demands of emerging use cases. In this paper, we revisit the concept of AI-native wireless systems, equipping them with the common sense necessary to transform them into artificial general intelligence (AGI)-native systems. These systems acquire common sense by exploiting different cognitive abilities such as perception, analogy, and reasoning, that enable them to generalize and deal with unforeseen scenarios. Towards developing the components of such a system, we start by showing how the perception module can be built through abstracting real-world elements into generalizable representations. These representations are then used to create a world model, founded on principles of causality and hyper-dimensional (HD) computing, that aligns with intuitive physics and enables analogical reasoning, that define common sense. Then, we explain how methods such as integrated information theory play a role in the proposed intent-driven and objective-driven planning methods that maneuver the AGI-native network to take actions. Next, we discuss how an AGI-native network can enable use cases related to human and autonomous agents: a) analogical reasoning for next-generation DTs, b) synchronized and resilient experiences for cognitive avatars, and c) brain-level metaverse experiences like holographic teleportation. Finally, we conclude with a set of recommendations to build AGI-native systems. Ultimately, we envision this paper as a roadmap for the beyond 6G era.","creator":"Walid Saad, Omar Hashash, Christo Kurisummoottil Thomas, Christina Chaccour, Merouane Debbah, Narayan Mandayam, Zhu Han"},{"id":"2405.02370","slug":"neuromorphic-correlates-of-artificial-consciousness","title":"Neuromorphic Correlates of Artificial Consciousness","link":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02370","abstract":"Abstract: The concept of neural correlates of consciousness (NCC), which suggests that specific neural activities are linked to conscious experiences, has gained widespread acceptance.

The construction of knowledge graphs is a multifaceted process involving various techniques, where researchers aim to extract the knowledge from existing resources for the construction since building from scratch entails significant labor and time costs. However, due to the pervasive issue of heterogeneity, the description diversity across different knowledge graphs can lead to mismatches between concepts, thereby impacting the efficacy of knowledge extraction. This Ph.D. study focuses on automatic knowledge graph extension, i.e., properly extending the reference knowledge graph by extracting and integrating concepts from one or more candidate knowledge graphs.

Dempster-Shafer theory of evidence is a well-known and effective reasoning method for representing epistemic uncertainty, which is closely related to subjective probability theory and possibility theory. Although they can be transformed to each other under some particular belief structures, there remains a lack of a clear and interpretable transformation process, as well as a unified approach for information processing. In this paper, we aim to address these issues from the perspectives of isopignistic belief functions and the hyper-cautious transferable belief model. Firstly, we propose an isopignistic transformation based on the belief evolution network. This transformation allows for the adjustment of the information granule while retaining the potential decision outcome. The isopignistic transformation is integrated with a hyper-cautious transferable belief model to establish a new canonical decomposition. This decomposition offers a reverse path between the possibility distribution and its isopignistic mass functions. The result of the canonical decomposition, called isopignistic function, is an identical information content distribution to reflect the propensity and relative commitment degree of the BPA. Furthermore, this paper introduces a method to reconstruct the basic belief assignment by adjusting the isopignistic function. It explores the advantages of this approach in modeling and handling uncertainty within the hyper-cautious transferable belief model.

Methods: PubMed and IEEEXplore databases were queried. Eligibility criteria included studies investigating the use of AI in enabling the autonomous navigation of catheters/guidewires in endovascular interventions. Following PRISMA, articles were assessed using QUADAS-2. PROSPERO: CRD42023392259.   Results: Among 462 studies, fourteen met inclusion criteria. Reinforcement learning (9/14, 64%) and learning from demonstration (7/14, 50%) were used as data-driven models for autonomous navigation. Studies predominantly utilised physical phantoms (10/14, 71%) and in silico (4/14, 29%) models. Experiments within or around the blood vessels of the heart were reported by the majority of studies (10/14, 71%), while simple non-anatomical vessel platforms were used in three studies (3/14, 21%), and the porcine liver venous system in one study.

Nevertheless, this presumption often proves unattainable in practical scenarios due to factors such as estimation errors, system updates, etc. This paper aims to take the first attempt to develop a triadic-OCD framework with certifiable robustness, provable optimality, and guaranteed convergence. In addition, the proposed triadic-OCD algorithm can be realized in a fully asynchronous distributed manner, easing the necessity of transmitting the data to a single server. This asynchronous mechanism also could mitigate the straggler issue that faced by traditional synchronous algorithm. We then analyze the non-asymptotic convergence property of triadic-OCD and derive its iteration complexity to achieve an $\\epsilon$-optimal point. Finally, extensive experiments have been conducted to elucidate the effectiveness of the proposed method.","creator":"Yancheng Huang, Kai Yang, Zelin Zhu, Leian Chen"},{"id":"2405.02374","slug":"protein-binding-affinity-prediction-under-multiple-substitutions-applying-egnns-on-residue-and-atomic-graphs-combined-with-language-model-information-egral","title":"Protein binding affinity prediction under multiple substitutions applying eGNNs on Residue and Atomic graphs combined with Language model information: eGRAL","link":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02374","abstract":"arXiv:2405.02374v1 Announce Type: cross  Abstract: Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) play a crucial role in numerous biological processes.

Human object recognition likely owes its robustness, in part, to the increasingly resilient representations that emerge along the hierarchy of the ventral visual cortex.

However, a significant obstacle to the real-world application of DRL is the lack of safety guarantees. Although DRL agents can satisfy system safety in expectation through reward shaping, designing agents to consistently meet hard constraints (e.g., safety specifications) at every time step remains a formidable challenge. In contrast, existing work in the field of safe control provides guarantees on persistent satisfaction of hard safety constraints. However, these methods require explicit analytical system dynamics models to synthesize safe control, which are typically inaccessible in DRL settings. In this paper, we present a model-free safe control algorithm, the implicit safe set algorithm, for synthesizing safeguards for DRL agents that ensure provable safety throughout training. The proposed algorithm synthesizes a safety index (barrier certificate) and a subsequent safe control law solely by querying a black-box dynamic function (e.g., a digital twin simulator). Moreover, we theoretically prove that the implicit safe set algorithm guarantees finite time convergence to the safe set and forward invariance for both continuous-time and discrete-time systems. We validate the proposed algorithm on the state-of-the-art Safety Gym benchmark, where it achieves zero safety violations while gaining $95\\% \\pm 9\\%$ cumulative reward compared to state-of-the-art safe DRL methods.

To address this, we propose RepAugment, an input-agnostic representation-level augmentation technique that outperforms SpecAugment, but is also suitable for respiratory sound classification with waveform pretrained models. Experimental results show that our approach outperforms the SpecAugment, demonstrating a substantial improvement in the accuracy of minority disease classes, reaching up to 7.14%.","creator":"June-Woo Kim, Miika Toikkanen, Sangmin Bae, Minseok Kim, Ho-Young Jung"},{"id":"2405.03000","slug":"medadapter-efficient-test-time-adaptation-of-large-language-models-towards-medical-reasoning","title":"MedAdapter: Efficient Test-Time Adaptation of Large Language Models towards Medical Reasoning","link":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03000","abstract":"arXiv:2405.03000v1 Announce Type: cross  Abstract: Despite their improved capabilities in generation and reasoning, adapting large language models (LLMs) to the biomedical domain remains challenging due to their immense size and corporate privacy.

However, the frequent updating of the local model brings the problem of large communication overhead. Recently, scholars have achieved the communication efficiency of federated learning mainly by model compression. But they ignore two problems: 1) network state of each client changes dynamically; 2) network state among clients is not the same. The clients with poor bandwidth update local model slowly, which leads to low efficiency. To address this challenge, we propose a communication-efficient federated learning algorithm with adaptive compression under dynamic bandwidth (called AdapComFL). Concretely, each client performs bandwidth awareness and bandwidth prediction. Then, each client adaptively compresses its local model via the improved sketch mechanism based on his predicted bandwidth. Further, the server aggregates sketched models with different sizes received. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, the experiments are based on real bandwidth data which are collected from the network topology we build, and benchmark datasets which are obtained from open repositories.

Denoising geospatial data is, therefore, essential, yet often challenging because the observations may comprise noise coming from different origins, including both environmental signals and instrumental artifacts, which are spatially and temporally correlated, thus hard to disentangle. This study addresses the denoising of multivariate time series acquired by irregularly distributed networks of sensors, requiring specific methods to handle the spatiotemporal correlation of the noise and the signal of interest. Specifically, our method focuses on the denoising of geodetic position time series, used to monitor ground displacement worldwide with centimeter- to-millimeter precision.

Ensemble learning has shown superiority in improving the accuracy and robustness of traditional machine learning by combining the outputs of multiple weak learners. However, adopting a similar idea to integrate different GNN models is challenging because of two reasons. First, GNN is notorious for its poor inference ability, so naively assembling multiple GNN models would deteriorate the inference efficiency. Second, when GNN models are trained with few labeled nodes, their performance are limited. In this case, the vanilla ensemble approach, e.g., majority vote, may be sub-optimal since most base models, i.e., GNNs, may make the wrong predictions. To this end, in this paper, we propose an efficient ensemble learner--E2GNN to assemble multiple GNNs in a learnable way by leveraging both labeled and unlabeled nodes. Specifically, we first pre-train different GNN models on a given data scenario according to the labeled nodes. Next, instead of directly combing their outputs for label inference, we train a simple multi-layer perceptron--MLP model to mimic their predictions on both labeled and unlabeled nodes. Then the unified MLP model is deployed to infer labels for unlabeled or new nodes. Since the predictions of unlabeled nodes from different GNN models may be incorrect, we develop a reinforced discriminator to effectively filter out those wrongly predicted nodes to boost the performance of MLP. By doing this, we suggest a principled approach to tackle the inference issues of GNN ensembles and maintain the merit of ensemble learning: improved performance.

Nowadays, 83% of software developers use Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate code.

Developers ranging from novices to experts use LLM tools not only to detect and patch bugs, but also to integrate generated code into their software.

We design an experiment involving three human-written benchmarks implemented in C++, JavaScript, and Python.

Our study shows that the energy efficiency of code generated by Code Llama is heavily-dependent on the chosen programming language and the specific code problem at hand.

Past works in reinforcement learning either assume costly interactions with an environment or propose algorithms finding potentially low quality local maxima. Motivated by EXP-type methods that integrate multiple agents (experts) for exploration in bandits with the assumption that rewards are bounded, we propose new algorithms, namely EXP4.P and EXP4-RL for exploration in the unbounded reward case, and demonstrate their effectiveness in these new settings. Unbounded rewards introduce challenges as the regret cannot be limited by the number of trials, and selecting suboptimal arms may lead to infinite regret. Specifically, we establish EXP4.P's regret upper bounds in both bounded and unbounded linear and stochastic contextual bandits. Surprisingly, we also find that by including one sufficiently competent expert, EXP4.P can achieve global optimality in the linear case. This unbounded reward result is also applicable to a revised version of EXP3.P in the Multi-armed Bandit scenario. In EXP4-RL, we extend EXP4.P from bandit scenarios to reinforcement learning to incentivize exploration by multiple agents, including one high-performing agent, for both efficiency and excellence. This algorithm has been tested on difficult-to-explore games and shows significant improvements in exploration compared to state-of-the-art.","creator":"Mengfan Xu, Diego Klabjan"},{"id":"2112.06433","slug":"generate-point-clouds-with-multiscale-details-from-graph-represented-structures","title":"Generate Point Clouds with Multiscale Details from Graph-Represented Structures","link":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.06433","abstract":"arXiv:2112.06433v3 Announce Type: replace-cross  Abstract: As details are missing in most representations of structures, the lack of controllability to more information is one of the major weaknesses in structure-based controllable point cloud generation. It is observable that definitions of details and structures are subjective. Details can be treated as structures on small scales. To represent structures in different scales at the same time, we present a graph-based representation of structures called the Multiscale Structure Graph (MSG). Given structures in multiple scales, similar patterns of local structures can be found at different scales, positions, and angles. The knowledge learned from a regional structure pattern shall be transferred to other similar patterns. An encoding and generation mechanism, namely the Multiscale Structure-based Point Cloud Generator (MSPCG) is proposed, which can simultaneously learn point cloud generation from local patterns with miscellaneous spatial properties. The proposed method supports multiscale editions on point clouds by editing the MSG. By generating point clouds from local structures and learning simultaneously in multiple scales, our MSPCG has better generalization ability and scalability. Trained on the ShapeNet, our MSPCG can generate point clouds from a given structure for unseen categories and indoor scenes. The experimental results show that our method significantly outperforms baseline methods.","creator":"Ximing Yang, Zhibo Zhang, Zhengfu He, Cheng Jin"},{"id":"2201.06317","slug":"language-model-based-paired-variational-autoencoders-for-robotic-language-learning","title":"Language Model-Based Paired Variational Autoencoders for Robotic Language Learning","link":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.06317","abstract":"arXiv:2201.06317v2 Announce Type: replace-cross  Abstract: Human infants learn language while interacting with their environment in which their caregivers may describe the objects and actions they perform.

Deep learning has employed attention to boost performance for many applications. Interestingly, the same attention design can suit processing different data modalities and can easily be incorporated into large networks. Furthermore, multiple complementary attention mechanisms can be incorporated into one network. Hence, attention techniques have become extremely attractive. However, the literature lacks a comprehensive survey on attention techniques to guide researchers in employing attention in their deep models. Note that, besides being demanding in terms of training data and computational resources, transformers only cover a single category in self-attention out of the many categories available. We fill this gap and provide an in-depth survey of 50 attention techniques, categorizing them by their most prominent features. We initiate our discussion by introducing the fundamental concepts behind the success of the attention mechanism. Next, we furnish some essentials such as the strengths and limitations of each attention category, describe their fundamental building blocks, basic formulations with primary usage, and applications specifically for computer vision.

This task has been extensively studied for traditional graph representations, such as knowledge graphs (KGs), using techniques like inductive logic programming (ILP). Existing ILP methods assume learning from KGs with static facts and binary relations. Beyond KGs, graph structures are widely present in other applications such as procedural instructions, scene graphs, and program executions. While ILP is beneficial for these applications, applying it to those graphs is nontrivial: they are more complex than KGs, which usually involve timestamps and n-ary relations, effectively a type of hypergraph with temporal events. In this work, we propose temporal inductive logic reasoning (TILR), an ILP method that reasons on temporal hypergraphs. To enable hypergraph reasoning, we introduce the multi-start random B-walk, a novel graph traversal method for hypergraphs. By combining it with a path-consistency algorithm, TILR learns logic rules by generalizing from both temporal and relational data.

Our work includes the presentation of a publicly available dataset called FarsTypo, which comprises 3.4 million words arranged in chronological order and tagged with their corresponding part-of-speech. These words cover a wide range of topics and linguistic styles. We develop an algorithm designed to apply Persian-specific errors to a scalable portion of these words, resulting in a parallel dataset of correct and incorrect words. By leveraging FarsTypo, we establish a strong foundation and conduct a thorough comparison of various methodologies employing different architectures. Additionally, we introduce a groundbreaking Deep Sequential Neural Network that utilizes both word and character embeddings, along with bidirectional LSTM layers, for token classification aimed at detecting typographical errors across 51 distinct classes. Our approach is contrasted with highly advanced industrial systems that, unlike this study, have been developed using a diverse range of resources. The outcomes of our final method proved to be highly competitive, achieving an accuracy of 97.62%, precision of 98.83%, recall of 98.61%, and surpassing others in terms of speed.","creator":"Mohammad Dehghani, Heshaam Faili"},{"id":"2305.18569","slug":"fairness-of-chatgpt","title":"Fairness of ChatGPT","link":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18569","abstract":"arXiv:2305.18569v2 Announce Type: replace-cross  Abstract: Understanding and addressing unfairness in LLMs are crucial for responsible AI deployment.

We formalize three domains in which users face everyday decisions: (1) choosing an assignment of reviewers to conference papers, (2) planning a multi-step itinerary in a city, and (3) negotiating travel plans for a group of friends. In each of these settings, AI assistants and users have disparate abilities that they must combine to arrive at the best decision: assistants can access and process large amounts of information, while users have preferences and constraints external to the system. For each task, we build a dialogue environment where agents receive a reward based on the quality of the final decision they reach. We evaluate LMs in self-play and in collaboration with humans and find that they fall short compared to human assistants, achieving much lower rewards despite engaging in longer dialogues. We highlight a number of challenges models face in decision-oriented dialogues, ranging from goal-directed behavior to reasoning and optimization, and release our environments as a testbed for future work.","creator":"Jessy Lin, Nicholas Tomlin, Jacob Andreas, Jason Eisner"},{"id":"2306.02786","slug":"navigating-explanatory-multiverse-through-counterfactual-path-geometry","title":"Navigating Explanatory Multiverse Through Counterfactual Path Geometry","link":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.02786","abstract":"arXiv:2306.02786v3 Announce Type: replace-cross  Abstract: Counterfactual explanations are the de facto standard when tasked with interpreting decisions of (opaque) predictive models. Their generation is often subject to algorithmic and domain-specific constraints -- such as density-based feasibility, and attribute (im)mutability or directionality of change -- that aim to maximise their real-life utility. In addition to desiderata with respect to the counterfactual instance itself, existence of a viable path connecting it with the factual data point, known as algorithmic recourse, has become an important technical consideration. While both of these requirements ensure that the steps of the journey as well as its destination are admissible, current literature neglects the multiplicity of such counterfactual paths. To address this shortcoming we introduce the novel concept of explanatory multiverse that encompasses all the possible counterfactual journeys. We then show how to navigate, reason about and compare the geometry of these trajectories with two methods: vector spaces and graphs. To this end, we overview their spacial properties -- such as affinity, branching, divergence and possible future convergence -- and propose an all-in-one metric, called opportunity potential, to quantify them. Implementing this (possibly interactive) explanatory process grants explainees agency by allowing them to select counterfactuals based on the properties of the journey leading to them in addition to their absolute differences. We show the flexibility, benefit and efficacy of such an approach through examples and quantitative evaluation on the German Credit and MNIST data sets.","creator":"Kacper Sokol, Edward Small, Yueqing Xuan"},{"id":"2306.05426","slug":"sequencematch-imitation-learning-for-autoregressive-sequence-modelling-with-backtracking","title":"SequenceMatch: Imitation Learning for Autoregressive Sequence Modelling with Backtracking","link":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.05426","abstract":"arXiv:2306.05426v3 Announce Type: replace-cross  Abstract: In many domains, autoregressive models can attain high likelihood on the task of predicting the next observation. However, this maximum-likelihood (MLE) objective does not necessarily match a downstream use-case of autoregressively generating high-quality sequences. The MLE objective weights sequences proportionally to their frequency under the data distribution, with no guidance for the model's behaviour out of distribution (OOD): leading to compounding error during autoregressive generation. In order to address this compounding error problem, we formulate sequence generation as an imitation learning (IL) problem. This allows us to minimize a variety of divergences between the distribution of sequences generated by an autoregressive model and sequences from a dataset, including divergences with weight on OOD generated sequences. The IL framework also allows us to incorporate backtracking by introducing a backspace action into the generation process. This further mitigates the compounding error problem by allowing the model to revert a sampled token if it takes the sequence OOD. Our resulting method, SequenceMatch, can be implemented without adversarial training or architectural changes. We identify the SequenceMatch-$\\chi^2$ divergence as a more suitable training objective for autoregressive models which are used for generation. We show that empirically, SequenceMatch training leads to improvements over MLE on text generation with language models and arithmetic.","creator":"Chris Cundy, Stefano Ermon"},{"id":"2306.07209","slug":"data-copilot-bridging-billions-of-data-and-humans-with-autonomous-workflow","title":"Data-Copilot: Bridging Billions of Data and Humans with Autonomous Workflow","link":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07209","abstract":"arXiv:2306.07209v3 Announce Type: replace-cross  Abstract: Various industries such as finance, meteorology, and energy produce vast amounts of heterogeneous data every day.

In this paper, we introduce a novel, straightforward yet effective pruning method, termed Wanda (Pruning by Weights and activations), designed to induce sparsity in pretrained LLMs. Motivated by the recent observation of emergent large magnitude features in LLMs, our approach prunes weights with the smallest magnitudes multiplied by the corresponding input activations, on a per-output basis. Notably, Wanda requires no retraining or weight update, and the pruned LLM can be used as is. We conduct a thorough evaluation of our method Wanda on LLaMA and LLaMA-2 across various language benchmarks.

However, adversarial users can construct inputs which circumvent attempts at alignment. In this work, we study adversarial alignment, and ask to what extent these models remain aligned when interacting with an adversarial user who constructs worst-case inputs (adversarial examples). These inputs are designed to cause the model to emit harmful content that would otherwise be prohibited. We show that existing NLP-based optimization attacks are insufficiently powerful to reliably attack aligned text models: even when current NLP-based attacks fail, we can find adversarial inputs with brute force. As a result, the failure of current attacks should not be seen as proof that aligned text models remain aligned under adversarial inputs.   However the recent trend in large-scale ML models is multimodal models that allow users to provide images that influence the text that is generated. We show these models can be easily attacked, i.e., induced to perform arbitrary un-aligned behavior through adversarial perturbation of the input image. We conjecture that improved NLP attacks may demonstrate this same level of adversarial control over text-only models.","creator":"Nicholas Carlini, Milad Nasr, Christopher A.

Corrective methods like statistical parity usually lead to bad accuracy and do not really achieve fairness in situations where there is a correlation between the sensitive attribute S and the legitimate attribute E (explanatory variable) that should determine the decision. To overcome these drawbacks, other notions of fairness have been proposed, in particular, conditional statistical parity and equal opportunity. However, E is often not directly observable in the data, i.e., it is a latent variable.

Most existing language agents, however, are not optimized using environment-specific rewards. Although some agents enable iterative refinement through verbal feedback, they do not reason and plan in ways that are compatible with gradient-based learning from rewards. This paper introduces a principled framework for reinforcing large language agents by learning a retrospective model, which automatically tunes the language agent prompts from environment feedback through policy gradient. Specifically, our proposed agent architecture learns from rewards across multiple environments and tasks, for fine-tuning a pre-trained language model which refines the language agent prompt by summarizing the root cause of prior failed attempts and proposing action plans. Experimental results on various tasks demonstrate that the language agents improve over time and that our approach considerably outperforms baselines that do not properly leverage gradients from the environment. This demonstrates that using policy gradient optimization to improve language agents, for which we believe our work is one of the first, seems promising and can be applied to optimize other models in the agent architecture to enhance agent performances over time.","creator":"Weiran Yao, Shelby Heinecke, Juan Carlos Niebles, Zhiwei Liu, Yihao Feng, Le Xue, Rithesh Murthy, Zeyuan Chen, Jianguo Zhang, Devansh Arpit, Ran Xu, Phil Mui, Huan Wang, Caiming Xiong, Silvio Savarese"},{"id":"2308.03314","slug":"gptscan-detecting-logic-vulnerabilities-in-smart-contracts-by-combining-gpt-with-program-analysis","title":"GPTScan: Detecting Logic Vulnerabilities in Smart Contracts by Combining GPT with Program Analysis","link":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.03314","abstract":"arXiv:2308.03314v3 Announce Type: replace-cross  Abstract: Smart contracts are prone to various vulnerabilities, leading to substantial financial losses over time. Current analysis tools mainly target vulnerabilities with fixed control or data-flow patterns, such as re-entrancy and integer overflow. However, a recent study on Web3 security bugs revealed that about 80% of these bugs cannot be audited by existing tools due to the lack of domain-specific property description and checking. Given recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs), it is worth exploring how Generative Pre-training Transformer (GPT) could aid in detecting logicc vulnerabilities.   In this paper, we propose GPTScan, the first tool combining GPT with static analysis for smart contract logic vulnerability detection. Instead of relying solely on GPT to identify vulnerabilities, which can lead to high false positives and is limited by GPT's pre-trained knowledge, we utilize GPT as a versatile code understanding tool. By breaking down each logic vulnerability type into scenarios and properties, GPTScan matches candidate vulnerabilities with GPT. To enhance accuracy, GPTScan further instructs GPT to intelligently recognize key variables and statements, which are then validated by static confirmation. Evaluation on diverse datasets with around 400 contract projects and 3K Solidity files shows that GPTScan achieves high precision (over 90%) for token contracts and acceptable precision (57.14%) for large projects like Web3Bugs. It effectively detects ground-truth logic vulnerabilities with a recall of over 70%, including 9 new vulnerabilities missed by human auditors.

Simulating RCMDPs requires computing the worst-case dynamics based on value estimates for each state, an approach which has previously been used in the Robust Constrained Policy Gradient (RCPG). Highlighting potential downsides of RCPG such as not robustifying the full constrained objective and the lack of incremental learning, this paper introduces two algorithms, called RCPG with Robust Lagrangian and Adversarial RCPG. RCPG with Robust Lagrangian modifies RCPG by taking the worst-case dynamics based on the Lagrangian rather than either the value or the constraint. Adversarial RCPG also formulates the worst-case dynamics based on the Lagrangian but learns this directly and incrementally as an adversarial policy through gradient descent rather than indirectly and abruptly through constrained optimisation on a sorted value list. A theoretical analysis first derives the Lagrangian policy gradient for the policy optimisation of both proposed algorithms and then the adversarial policy gradient to learn the adversary for Adversarial RCPG.

We present a streamlined reactive UAV system that employs visual servoing by harnessing the capabilities of open vocabulary image segmentation. This approach can adapt to various scenarios with minimal adjustments, bypassing the necessity for extensive data accumulation for refining internal models, thanks to its open vocabulary methodology. Given the limitations imposed by local authorities, our primary focus centers on operations originating from altitudes of 100 meters. This choice is deliberate, as numerous preceding works have dealt with altitudes up to 30 meters, aligning with the capabilities of small stereo cameras. Consequently, we leave the remaining 20m to be navigated using conventional 3D path planning methods. Utilizing monocular cameras and image segmentation, our findings demonstrate the system's capability to successfully execute landing maneuvers at altitudes as low as 20 meters. However, this approach is vulnerable to intermittent and occasionally abrupt fluctuations in the segmentation between frames in a video stream. To address this challenge, we enhance the image segmentation output by introducing what we call a dynamic focus: a masking mechanism that self adjusts according to the current landing stage. This dynamic focus guides the control system to avoid regions beyond the drone's safety radius projected onto the ground, thus mitigating the problems with fluctuations.

To let the engineers appropriately reflect their intent to constraints and handle them with minimal computation overhead, two constraint types and an efficient policy optimization algorithm are suggested. The learning framework is applied to train locomotion controllers for several legged robots with different morphology and physical attributes to traverse challenging terrains. Extensive simulation and real-world experiments demonstrate that performant controllers can be trained with significantly less reward engineering, by tuning only a single reward coefficient.

We propose the Multi-Object Graph Affordance Network which models complex compound object affordances by learning the outcomes of robot actions that facilitate interactions between an object and a compound. Given the depth images of the objects, the object features are extracted via convolution operations and encoded in the nodes of graph neural networks. Graph convolution operations are used to encode the state of the compounds, which are used as input to decoders to predict the outcome of the object-compound interactions. After learning the compound object affordances, given different tasks, the learned outcome predictors are used to plan sequences of stack actions that involve stacking objects on top of each other, inserting smaller objects into larger containers and passing through ring-like objects through poles.

Furthermore, in real-world scenarios, data distributions can gradually change across a sequence of sequential domains. While current methodologies primarily focus on improving model effectiveness within these new domains, they often overlook fairness issues throughout the learning process. In response, we introduce an innovative framework called Counterfactual Fairness-Aware Domain Generalization with Sequential Autoencoder (CDSAE). This approach effectively separates environmental information and sensitive attributes from the embedded representation of classification features. This concurrent separation not only greatly improves model generalization across diverse and unfamiliar domains but also effectively addresses challenges related to unfair classification. Our strategy is rooted in the principles of causal inference to tackle these dual issues. To examine the intricate relationship between semantic information, sensitive attributes, and environmental cues, we systematically categorize exogenous uncertainty factors into four latent variables: 1) semantic information influenced by sensitive attributes, 2) semantic information unaffected by sensitive attributes, 3) environmental cues influenced by sensitive attributes, and 4) environmental cues unaffected by sensitive attributes. By incorporating fairness regularization, we exclusively employ semantic information for classification purposes. Empirical validation on synthetic and real-world datasets substantiates the effectiveness of our approach, demonstrating improved accuracy levels while ensuring the preservation of fairness in the evolving landscape of continuous domains.","creator":"Yujie Lin, Chen Zhao, Minglai Shao, Baoluo Meng, Xujiang Zhao, Haifeng Chen"},{"id":"2309.13285","slug":"collision-avoidance-and-navigation-for-a-quadrotor-swarm-using-end-to-end-deep-reinforcement-learning","title":"Collision Avoidance and Navigation for a Quadrotor Swarm Using End-to-end Deep Reinforcement Learning","link":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.13285","abstract":"arXiv:2309.13285v2 Announce Type: replace-cross  Abstract: End-to-end deep reinforcement learning (DRL) for quadrotor control promises many benefits -- easy deployment, task generalization and real-time execution capability.

To improve semantic model generalization, existing methods augment and synthesize agricultural data to account for uncontrolled field conditions. However, given highly varied field conditions, these methods have limitations.

Our work pushes the boundaries of leveraging LLMs for computer vision tasks, significantly departing from conventional practices that typically necessitate a multi-modal vision-language setup with associated language prompts, inputs, or outputs. We demonstrate that our approach consistently enhances performance across a diverse range of tasks, encompassing pure 2D and 3D visual recognition tasks (e.g., image and point cloud classification), temporal modeling tasks (e.g., action recognition), non-semantic tasks (e.g., motion forecasting), and multi-modal tasks (e.g., 2D/3D visual question answering and image-text retrieval). Such improvements are a general phenomenon, applicable to various types of LLMs (e.g., LLaMA and OPT) and different LLM transformer blocks.

This hypothesis is empirically supported by the observation that the feature activation, after training with LLM transformer blocks, exhibits a stronger focus on relevant regions.

While there has been a longstanding interest in automating of short-answer grading (ASAG), but previous approaches have been technically complex, limiting their use in formative assessment contexts. The newest generation of Large Language Models (LLMs) potentially makes grading short answer questions more feasible. This paper investigates the potential for the newest version of LLMs to be used in ASAG, specifically in the grading of short answer questions for formative assessments, in two ways. First, it introduces a novel dataset of short answer reading comprehension questions, drawn from a set of reading assessments conducted with over 150 students in Ghana.

We also used a fine-tuned DistilBERT model for classification detecting which President delivered which address, with very good results (accuracy 93% - 95% depending on the run). An analogous task was performed to determine the year of writing, and we were able to pin it down to about 4 years (which is a single presidential term).   It is worth noting that SOTU addresses provide relatively small writing samples (with about 8'000 words on average, and varying widely from under 2'000 words to more than 20'000), and that the number of authors is relatively large (we used SOTU addresses of 42 US presidents). This shows that the techniques employed turn out to be rather efficient, while all the computations described in this note can be performed using a single GPU instance of Google Colab.

However, the increasing size and non-convexity in large-scale models make IFs inaccurate. We suspect that the fragility comes from the first-order approximation which may cause nuisance changes in parameters irrelevant to the examined data. However, simply computing influence from the chosen parameters can be misleading, as it fails to nullify the hidden effects of unselected parameters on the analyzed data. Thus, our approach introduces generalized IFs, precisely estimating target parameters' influence while nullifying nuisance gradient changes on fixed parameters. We identify target update parameters closely associated with the input data by the output- and gradient-based parameter selection methods. We verify the generalized IFs with various alternatives of IFs on the class removal and label change tasks. The experiments align with the \"less is more\" philosophy, demonstrating that updating only 5\\% of the model produces more accurate results than other influence functions across all tasks.

However, training such networks requires a large amount of human-annotated datasets with pixel-level annotations, which is a highly labor-intensive and time-consuming process.

Subsequently, a generative adversarial network is trained to restore the corrupted regions by leveraging the semantic context learned from surrounding uncorrupted regions. During the testing phase, an error map is generated by calculating the difference between the input and restored images, which allows for pixel-wise crack detection.

Unlike in image or text data, we find that negative transfer could commonly occur in graph-structured data, even when source and target graphs have semantic similarities. Specifically, we identify that structural differences significantly amplify the dissimilarities in the node embeddings across graphs. To mitigate this, we bring a new insight in this paper: for semantically similar graphs, although structural differences lead to significant distribution shift in node embeddings, their impact on subgraph embeddings could be marginal. Building on this insight, we introduce Subgraph Pooling (SP) by aggregating nodes sampled from a k-hop neighborhood and Subgraph Pooling++ (SP++) by a random walk, to mitigate the impact of graph structural differences on knowledge transfer.

To tackle the intrinsic sparsity issue of real-world user mobility traces, spatiotemporal contexts have been shown as significantly useful. Existing solutions mostly incorporate spatiotemporal distances between locations in mobility traces, either by feeding them as additional inputs to Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) or by using them to search for informative past hidden states for prediction. However, such distance-based methods fail to capture the time-varying temporal regularities of human mobility, where human mobility is often more regular in the morning than in other periods, for example; this suggests the usefulness of the actual timestamps besides the temporal distances. Against this background, we propose REPLAY, a general RNN architecture learning to capture the time-varying temporal regularities for location prediction. Specifically, REPLAY not only resorts to the spatiotemporal distances in sparse trajectories to search for the informative past hidden states, but also accommodates the time-varying temporal regularities by incorporating smoothed timestamp embeddings using Gaussian weighted averaging with timestamp-specific learnable bandwidths, which can flexibly adapt to the temporal regularities of different strengths across different timestamps.

In Study 1, we expand this research by using an LLM ensemble approach consisting of a crowd of twelve LLMs. We compare the aggregated LLM predictions on 31 binary questions to that of a crowd of 925 human forecasters from a three-month forecasting tournament. Our preregistered main analysis shows that the LLM crowd outperforms a simple no-information benchmark and is not statistically different from the human crowd. In exploratory analyses, we find that these two approaches are equivalent with respect to medium-effect-size equivalence bounds. We also observe an acquiescence effect, with mean model predictions being significantly above 50%, despite an almost even split of positive and negative resolutions.

Such six tasks include salient/camouflaged/transparent object detection, as well as polyp detection, skin lesion detection, and industrial anomaly detection. We examine the performance of three recent open-source LVLMs, including MiniGPT-v2, LLaVA-1.5, and Shikra, on both visual recognition and localization under these tasks. Moreover, we conduct empirical investigations utilizing the aforementioned LVLMs together with GPT-4V, assessing their multi-modal understanding capabilities in general tasks including object counting, absurd question answering, affordance reasoning, attribute recognition, and spatial relation reasoning. Our investigations reveal that these LVLMs demonstrate limited proficiency not only in specialized tasks but also in general tasks. We delve deep into this inadequacy and uncover several potential factors, including limited cognition in specialized tasks, object hallucination, text-to-image interference, and decreased robustness in complex problems. We hope this study could provide useful insights for the future development of LVLMs, helping researchers improve LVLMs to cope with both general and specialized applications.","creator":"Yao Jiang, Xinyu Yan, Ge-Peng Ji, Keren Fu, Meijun Sun, Huan Xiong, Deng-Ping Fan, Fahad Shahbaz Khan"},{"id":"2403.06659","slug":"zero-shot-ecg-classification-with-multimodal-learning-and-test-time-clinical-knowledge-enhancement","title":"Zero-Shot ECG Classification with Multimodal Learning and Test-time Clinical Knowledge Enhancement","link":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06659","abstract":"arXiv:2403.06659v2 Announce Type: replace-cross  Abstract: Electrocardiograms (ECGs) are non-invasive diagnostic tools crucial for detecting cardiac arrhythmic diseases in clinical practice. While ECG Self-supervised Learning (eSSL) methods show promise in representation learning from unannotated ECG data, they often overlook the clinical knowledge that can be found in reports. This oversight and the requirement for annotated samples for downstream tasks limit eSSL's versatility. In this work, we address these issues with the Multimodal ECG Representation Learning (MERL}) framework. Through multimodal learning on ECG records and associated reports, MERL is capable of performing zero-shot ECG classification with text prompts, eliminating the need for training data in downstream tasks. At test time, we propose the Clinical Knowledge Enhanced Prompt Engineering (CKEPE) approach, which uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to exploit external expert-verified clinical knowledge databases, generating more descriptive prompts and reducing hallucinations in LLM-generated content to boost zero-shot classification. Based on MERL, we perform the first benchmark across six public ECG datasets, showing the superior performance of MERL compared against eSSL methods. Notably, MERL achieves an average AUC score of 75.2% in zero-shot classification (without training data), 3.2% higher than linear probed eSSL methods with 10\\% annotated training data, averaged across all six datasets.","creator":"Che Liu, Zhongwei Wan, Cheng Ouyang, Anand Shah, Wenjia Bai, Rossella Arcucci"},{"id":"2403.09053","slug":"towards-a-theory-of-model-distillation","title":"Towards a theory of model distillation","link":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09053","abstract":"arXiv:2403.09053v2 Announce Type: replace-cross  Abstract: Distillation is the task of replacing a complicated machine learning model with a simpler model that approximates the original [BCNM06,HVD15].

Inspired by the Mixture-of-Experts mechanism utilized in large language models (LLMs), MoA distributes the generation workload between two attention pathways: a personalized branch and a non-personalized prior branch. MoA is designed to retain the original model's prior by fixing its attention layers in the prior branch, while minimally intervening in the generation process with the personalized branch that learns to embed subjects in the layout and context generated by the prior branch. A novel routing mechanism manages the distribution of pixels in each layer across these branches to optimize the blend of personalized and generic content creation. Once trained, MoA facilitates the creation of high-quality, personalized images featuring multiple subjects with compositions and interactions as diverse as those generated by the original model.

In this work, we propose a simple and effective 3D hand mesh reconstruction network HandSSCA, which is the first to incorporate state space modeling into the field of hand pose estimation. In the network, we have designed a novel state space channel attention module that extends the effective sensory field, extracts hand features in the spatial dimension, and enhances hand regional features in the channel dimension. This design helps to reconstruct a complete and detailed hand mesh. Extensive experiments conducted on well-known datasets featuring challenging hand-object occlusions (such as FREIHAND, DEXYCB, and HO3D) demonstrate that our proposed HandSSCA achieves state-of-the-art performance while maintaining a minimal parameter count.","creator":"Zixun Jiao, Xihan Wang, Quanli Gao"},{"id":"2405.01242","slug":"tramba-a-hybrid-transformer-and-mamba-architecture-for-practical-audio-and-bone-conduction-speech-super-resolution-and-enhancement-on-mobile-and-wearable-platforms","title":"TRAMBA: A Hybrid Transformer and Mamba Architecture for Practical Audio and Bone Conduction Speech Super Resolution and Enhancement on Mobile and Wearable Platforms","link":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01242","abstract":"arXiv:2405.01242v2 Announce Type: replace-cross  Abstract: We propose TRAMBA, a hybrid transformer and Mamba architecture for acoustic and bone conduction speech enhancement, suitable for mobile and wearable platforms.

The first approach is training-time defense, such as adversarial training, which can mitigate poisoning effects but is computationally intensive. The other approach is pre-training purification, e.g., image short squeezing, which consists of several simple compressions but often encounters challenges in dealing with various UEs.

Most of the existing research assumes that the strategy is deployed on ground-based stations or UAVs, which will be ineffective in an environment lacking infrastructure and continuous energy supply.

Traditional methods using transformer-based models often face limitations stemming from the lack of specialized databases, which adversely affect their performance with objects of varying orientations and scales. This underscores the need for more adaptable, lightweight models. In response, this paper introduces two innovative approaches that significantly enhance detection and segmentation capabilities for small aerial objects. Firstly, we explore the use of the SAHI framework on the newly introduced lightweight YOLO v9 architecture, which utilizes Programmable Gradient Information (PGI) to reduce the substantial information loss typically encountered in sequential feature extraction processes. The paper employs the Vision Mamba model, which incorporates position embeddings to facilitate precise location-aware visual understanding, combined with a novel bidirectional State Space Model (SSM) for effective visual context modeling. This State Space Model adeptly harnesses the linear complexity of CNNs and the global receptive field of Transformers, making it particularly effective in remote sensing image classification. Our experimental results demonstrate substantial improvements in detection accuracy and processing efficiency, validating the applicability of these approaches for real-time small object detection across diverse aerial scenarios.

Further analysis of one of these viruses, the Turnip Crinkle Virus (TCV) that hijack mitochondria, showed that despite perturbing mitochondrial integrity, TCV does not trigger a typical mitophagy response. Instead, TCV and Turnip yellow mosaic virus (TYMV) infection activates a distinct selective autophagy mechanism, where oligomeric metabolic enzymes moonlight as selective autophagy receptors and degrade key executors of defense and cell death such as EDS1.

We have previously discovered that a simple amino acid, tryptophan (Trp), as well as its metabolite, the plant hormone indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), can inhibit radicle elongation of Orobanche minor. These results suggest that auxin plays a crucial role in the radicle elongation step in root parasitic plants. In this report, we used various auxin chemical probes to dissect the auxin function in the radicle growth of O. minor and Striga hermonthica. We found that synthetic auxins inhibited radicle elongation. In addition, auxin receptor antagonist, auxinole, rescued the inhibition of radicle growth by exogenous IAA. Moreover, a polar transport inhibitor of auxin, N-1-naphthylphthalamic acid (NPA), affected radicle tropism. We also proved that exogenously applied Trp is converted into IAA in O. minor seeds, and auxinole partly rescued this radicle elongation. Our data demonstrate a pivotal role of auxin in radicle growth.

The primed state of plants is correlated with a more rapid and efficient response, achievable by subjecting plants to recurrent stressors. Consequently, priming constitutes a dynamic transitional process between two distinct biological states, necessitating the establishment and maintenance of transcriptional memory mechanisms. Research on transcriptional memory has revealed molecular mechanisms including protein and transcription factor accumulation, as well as epigenetic modulations. Nonetheless, there remains a dearth of understanding regarding the interplay among the dynamics of transcriptional stress memory, its preservation, and the resultant emergent properties conferred upon the organism once primed. Here, we found that the robustness of transcriptional memory associated with repeated mechanical stimuli played an antagonistic role in the priming of plant defense. Incorporating experiments and computational modeling, we have analyzed the transcriptional stress memory of Arabidopsis thaliana subjected to daily acoustic stimulations. The observed enhanced resistance to the pathogen Sclerotinia sclerotiorum following three rounds of repeated acoustic stimulations is attributed to three primary mechanisms: the activation of a first line of defense in non-inoculated plants, an increase defense-associated gene diversification, and gene priming. These mechanisms are sustained by a transcriptional stress memory involving thousands of genes, likely regulated mostly by transcription factor cascades. Upon comparing the predictions of the transcriptional stress memory model with experimental outcomes, we propose that priming does not arise from the sequential activation of different pathways but rather from the simultaneous modulation of a broad spectrum of pathways. Pathway redundancy in the transcriptional memory topology imparts robustness to plant defense priming. Consequently, primed plants exhibit independence from limited genetic variations, preventing critical loss of resistance observed in naive plants. Pathway redundancies also imply strong limitations in increasing plant defense. Thus, plants remain unaffected by an increase in the daily rate of RAS and exhibited a stress memorization time limited to 1.5 days.","creator":"Hadj-Amor, K., Leger, O., Raffaele, S., Kovacic, M., Duclos, A., Carvalho-Silva, P., Garcia, F., Barbacci, A."},{"id":"2024.05.02.592228v1","slug":"multiomic-analysis-of-genes-related-to-oil-traits-in-legumes-provide-insights-into-lipid-metabolism-and-oil-richness-in-soybean","title":"Multiomic analysis of genes related to oil traits in legumes provide insights into lipid metabolism and oil richness in soybean","link":"http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2024.05.02.592228v1?rss=1","abstract":"Soybean (Glycine max) and common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) diverged approximately 19 million years ago.

The affected Cannabis sativa hemp plant exhibited severe symptoms, including alterations in pigmentation, leaf morphology such as chlorosis, necrotic tissue formation, and surface wear on the leaves. The complete genome sequence of the Cannabis sativa TNVA was 3,656 nucleotides long, containing five putative ORFs, and was classified in the family Tombusviridae, genus Alphanecrovirus, and belonging to the Necro-like clade based on RdRp protein phylogenetic analysis. Our analysis revealed a well-conserved RdRp protein among the Alphanecroviruses, with 89% of the amino acid residues in the peptide being entirely conserved. In contrast, the coat protein exhibited significantly higher variability, with only 49.3% of the residues being 100% conserved. Regarding the viral genome expression of Cannabis sativa TNVA, we observed that the virus was highly abundant in the leaves of the diseased plant, ranking among the topmost abundant transcripts, occupying the percentile position of 3.06%. Overall, our study generated the first reference genome of TNVA virus in the tropical region and reported the first case of this virus infecting a Cannabis sativa plant.","creator":"Lopez-Jimenez, J., Palacio-Torres, H.

Congruence of alternate ionomic profiling platforms, i.e., inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS), neutron activation analysis (NAA) and laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS), was performed on leaf samples from a subset of the population. Significant agreement was observed across the three platforms with some notable exceptions for individual elements. Subsequently, we used the ICP-MS platform to profile the 584 genotypes focusing on 20 elements. GWAS performed using a set of high-density (>8.2 million) single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP), identified multiple loci significantly associated with variations in these mineral elements. The potential causal genes for variations in the ionome were significantly enriched in genes whose homologs were previously associated to ion homeostasis in other species. Notably, a polymorphic copy of the high-affinity molybdenum transporter MOT1 was found directly associated to molybdenum content in leaf tissues. The results of the GWAS also provided evidence of physiological and genetic interactions between mineral elements in poplar. The new candidate genes predicted to play a key role in cross-homeostasis of multiple elements are new targets for engineering a variety of traits of interest in tree species.","creator":"Ployet, R., Feng, K., Zhang, J., Baxter, I., Glasgow, D.

Under N and R, SHS mulch reduced evaporation by 71% and 64%, respectively; while SHS+biochar reduced evaporation by 61% and 47%, respectively, in comparison with the control (p < 0.05). Total transpiration significantly increased in SHS plants by 311% and 385% under N and R, respectively.

Metabolomics analysis showed significantly higher relative abundance of amino acids, sugars, fatty acids, and organic acids in the leaves of control plants relative to other treatments, as a response to water or nutrient stress induced by excessive water loss through evaporation. Next, we found a higher concentration of D-Mannose, D-Fructose, glucose, and malic acid in plants grown with SHS or biochar treatment under N and R irrigation, attributed to increased water/nutrient-use efficiency and carbon assimilation because of higher photosynthesis rates than in the control plants. Our results show that, our complementary technologies could address the challenge of water loss via evaporation from soil and maximize soil nutrient retention for improving plant growth in arid regions.

In Brassicaceae, there is high genetic diversity at the locus controlling self-incompatibility, and dozens of distinct alleles are organized in a complex dominance hierarchy: the gene controlling self-incompatibility specificity in pollen shows monoallelic expression in heterozygote individuals, and this is achieved through the action of sRNA precursors that resemble miRNAs, although the underlying molecular mechanisms remain elusive. Here, we engineered Arabidopsis thaliana lines expressing components of the Arabidopsis halleri self-incompatibility system, and we then used a reverse genetics approach to pinpoint the pathways underlying the function of these sRNA precursors. We showed that they trigger a robust decrease in transcript abundance of the recessive pollen self-incompatibility genes, but not through the canonical transcriptional or post-transcriptional gene silencing pathways. Furthermore, we observed that single sRNA precursors are typically processed into hundreds of sRNA molecules of distinct sizes, abundance levels and ARGONAUTE loading preferences. This heterogeneity closely resembles that of proto-miRNAs, the evolutionary ancestors of miRNAs. Our results suggest that these apparently arbitrary features, which are often associated with lack of effects on gene expression, are crucial in the context of the self-incompatibility dominance hierarchy since they allow for one sRNA precursor of a given allele to repress multiple other recessive alleles. This study not only provides an in-depth characterization of the molecular features underlying complex dominance interactions, but also constitutes a unique example of how specific evolutionary constraints shape the progression of sRNA precursors along the proto-miRNA - miRNA evolutionary continuum.","creator":"Batista, R.

However, the mechanism of downstream calcium signal transduction in loquat fruitlets under freezing stress is currently unclear. Calcium-depend protein kinase (CDPK) as the most particular calcium sensor family in plants, play an important role in multiple stress signal transduction including freezing. In this study, we identified the loquat CDPK family on a genome-wide scale. A total of 34 EjCDPK genes were identified and studied for basic structural and phylogenetic features. EjCDPKs can be divided into four subgroups phylogenetically. The patterns of exon-intron and protein motif are highly conserved among the subgroups. Collinearity analysis identified several segmental duplicate events in EjCDPK family. RNA-seq based transcription analysis indicated that partial of EjCDPKs differently expressed in response to freezing stress with tissue-specific. Moreover, we preformed correlation analysis between expression value and trait data of loquat fruitlet under freezing stress by weighted co-expression gene network. After that, EjCDPK25 was selected as the candidate because of its potential freezing stress response function. Protein kinase related GO terms were enriched in EjCDPK25 co-expression genes, and then QPCR was performed to examine the target gene's expression pattern. In addition, EjCDPK25 was cloned to construct overexpression vector to obtain transgenic Arabidopsis plants. Transgenic and wild-type Arabidopsis were suffered freezing stress treatments (-5). The results showed that the survival rate of EjCDPK25 overexpressing transgenic Arabidopsis was significantly higher than WT. In summary, this study identified loquat CDPK family firstly, and our data provide significant insights into the evolution and function of loquat CDPKs.

Xoo strain PXO99A encodes nineteen TALEs, but the host targets of all these TALEs have not been defined. A meta-analysis of rice transcriptome profiles revealed a gene annotated as flavonol synthase/flavanone-3 hydroxylase (henceforth OsS5H/FNS-03g) to be highly induced upon Xoo infection.

OsS5H/FNS-03g functionally complemented its Arabidopsis homologue AtDMR6, a well-studied disease susceptibility locus.

This study aims to understand the 3D model structure of enzymes involved in fatty acid synthesis, and their catalytic sites compared to other Scenedesmus species.

Detailed comparative analyses of these identified enzymes were carried out using various bioinformatics tools.

Species distributions are shifting or decreasing, with alpine plant species being particularly threatened. Natural population monitoring allows the assessment of the impact of human-induced global changes. However, traditional monitoring strategies based on individual counts may produce delayed signals of biodiversity loss. These approaches overlook the fact that genetic diversity is the fundamental basis for evolutionary processes, as it enables populations to adapt to environmental changes, including those caused by climate change. Here, we draw attention to the use of genetic diversity in monitoring schemes to anticipate negative trends in biodiversity and propose two fundamental methodologies: genomics and the use of herbarium specimens. Firstly, in contrast to genetic markers conventionally used to quantify genetic diversity, such as microsatellite markers, genomic approaches provide a vast amount of data that does not require previous knowledge of the studied organism, making them suitable for the study of non-model species. Secondly, herbaria worldwide serve as excellent sources of plant material for comparative studies across time with their precise chronologically recorded collection data. The accuracy of genetic diversity estimates increases with sample size, therefore a large number of vouchers is ideally required. However, the availability of specimens from the same species and populations in public herbaria is limited. Different strategies to quantify genetic diversity are proposed depending on the number of specimens available and their geographic distribution. Finally, we illustrate the potential of this approach in the most restrictive scenario, where only a few individuals are available, and there is no conspecific reference genome. Even in this restrictive scenario, there are signs of genetic depauperation in an alpine species with a narrow distribution, but not in a widely distributed congeneric.","creator":"Viveiros-Moniz, M., Garcia-Munoz, A., Matias, L., Abdelaziz, M., Munoz-Pajares, A.

The GENERAL CONTROL NON-DEREPRESSIBLE 5 (GCN5) is a HAT that specifically acetylates H3K14 residues. GCN5 has been associated with cell division and differentiation, meristem function, root, stem, foliar and floral development, and plant environmental response. The flowers of gcn5-6 plants display reduced length of stamen and exhibit male sterility relative to the wild-type plants. We show these effects may arise from gibberellin (GA) signaling defects. The signaling pathway of bioactive GAs depends on the proteolysis of their repressors, DELLA proteins. The DELLA protein, REPRESSOR OF GA (RGA), represses plant growth, inflorescence, flower and seed development. Our molecular data indicate that GCN5 is required for activation and H3K14 acetylation of genes involved in the late stages of GA biosynthesis and catabolism. We studied the genetic interaction of RGA and GCN5; RGA can partially suppress GCN5 action. The reduced elongation of the stamen filament of gcn5-6 mutants is reversed in the rga-t2;gcn5-6 double mutants. This mechanism involved suppressing the GCN5 effect on the expression and histone acetylation in GAI-locus by RGA. Interestingly, RGA and RGL2 do not suppress ADA2b function, suggesting that ADA2b acts downstream in GA signaling and is distinct from GCN5 activity. In conclusion, we propose that the action of GCN5 on stamen elongation is mediated partially by RGA and GA signaling.","creator":"Balouri, C., Poulios, S., Tsompani, D., Spyropoulou, Z., Ketikoglou, M.-C., Kaldis, A., Doonan, J.

The soybean cyst nematode, Heterodera glycines, obligate root parasite produces secretions, generating a multinucleate nurse cell called a syncytium, a byproduct of the merged cytoplasm of 200-250 root cells, occurring through cell wall maceration. The common cytoplasmic pool, surrounded by an intact plasma membrane, provides a source from which H. glycines derives nourishment but without killing the parasitized cell during a susceptible reaction. The syncytium is also the site of a naturally-occurring defense response that happens in specific G. max genotypes. Transcriptomic analyses of RNA isolated from the syncytium undergoing the process of defense have identified that one of the 11 G. max PGIPs, GmPGIP11, is expressed during defense. Functional transgenic analyses show roots undergoing GmPGIP11 overexpression (OE) experience an increase in its relative transcript abundance (RTA) as compared to the ribosomal protein 21 (GmRPS21) control, leading to a decrease in H. glycines parasitism as compared to the overexpression control.

PIN auxin transporters, on account of their polarized distribution, are instrumental in guiding auxin flow across tissues. Based on protein length and subcellular localization, the PIN family is classified into two groups: plasma membrane (PM)-localized long PINs and endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-localized short PINs. The origin of PINs was traced to the alga Klebsormidium, with a single PM-localized long KfPIN. Bryophytes, the earliest land plant clade, represent the initial clade harboring the short PINs. We tracked the evolutionary trajectory of the short PINs and explored their function and localization in the model bryophyte Marchantia polymorpha, which carries four short and one long PIN. Our findings reveal that all short MpPINs can export auxin, and they are all PM-localized with MpPINX and MpPINW exhibiting asymmetric distribution. We identified a unique miniW domain within the MpPINW hydrophilic loop region, which is sufficient for its PM localization. Phosphorylation site mutations within the miniW domain abolish the PM localization. These findings not only identify the essential sequence determinant of PINs PM localization but also provide a unique insight into the evolution of ER-localized PINs. Short MpPINW, which is evolutionarily positioned between the ancestral long PINs and contemporary short PINs, still preserves the critical region essential for its PM localization. We propose that throughout land plant evolution, the unique miniW domain has been gradually lost thus converting the PM-localized short PINs in bryophytes to ER-localized short PINs in angiosperms.

The diurnal.plant.tools database constitutes a repository of gene expression profiles from 17 members of the Archaeplastida lineage, with built-in tools facilitating cross-species comparisons. In this database update, we expand the dataset with diurnal gene expression from 4 agriculturally significant crop species and Marchantia, a plant of evolutionary significance. Notably, the inclusion of diurnal gene expression data for Marchantia enables researchers to glean insights into the evolutionary trajectories of the circadian clock and other biological processes spanning from algae to angiosperms. Moreover, by integrating data from tissue, and perturbation gene expression datasets for Marchantia from other databases, the diurnal dataset complements it to offer a comprehensive overview of gene functions across varied biological contexts. This expanded database serves as a valuable resource for elucidating the intricacies of diurnal gene regulation and its evolutionary underpinnings in plant biology.","creator":"Tan, Q.

Dynamics, such as changes in price, result from agent-level interactions that ubiquitously occur via market maker agents acting as liquidity providers. Two additional agents are considered: trend investors use a deep convolutional neural network paired with a deep Q-learning framework to inform trading decisions by analysing price history; and value investors use a static price-target to determine their trade directions and sizes. We demonstrate that our novel inclusion of a network topology with market makers facilitates explorations into various market structures. First, we present the model and an overview of its mechanics. Second, we validate our findings via comparison to the real-world: we demonstrate a fat-tailed distribution of price changes, auto-correlated volatility, a skew negatively correlated to market maker positioning, predictable price-history patterns and more. Finally, we demonstrate that our network-based model can lend insights into the effect of market-structure on price-action. For example, we show that markets with sparsely connected intermediaries can have a critical point of fragmentation, beyond which the market forms distinct clusters and arbitrage becomes rapidly possible between the prices of different market makers.

We aim to understand the potential consequences of deeply uncertain systemic events on the supply chain resilience and how does the information precision affect individual agents' choices and the chain-level preparedness to aggregate shocks. Augmenting a parsimonious supply chain model with uncertainty, we analyse the relationship between the upstream sourcing decisions and the supply chain survival probability. Both risk-averse and ambiguity-averse individually-optimising agents' upstream sourcing paths are efficient but can become vulnerable to aggregate shocks. In contrast, a chain-level coordination of downstream firm sourcing decisions can qualitatively improve the robustness of the entire supply chain compared to the individual decision-making baseline. Such a robust decision making ensures that in the presence of an aggregate shock - independently of its realisation - part of upstream suppliers will survive and the final goods' supply will be ensured even under the most demanding circumstances. Our results also indicate that an input source diversification extracts a cost in foregone efficiency.","creator":"d'Artis Kancs"},{"id":"2207.04929","slug":"information-design-in-cheap-talk","title":"Information Design in Cheap Talk","link":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.04929","abstract":"arXiv:2207.04929v2 Announce Type: replace  Abstract: An uninformed sender publicly commits to an informative experiment about an uncertain state, privately observes its outcome, and sends a cheap-talk message to a receiver.

Our subsequent analyses find that the deflationary effects are partially driven by lower consumption, while farm input costs show no significant changes.

It may then serve the instrumental function of enabling researchers and readers to compare two or more estimands. Defined as the regression coefficient when dependent variable (DV) and independent variable (IV) are both on conceptual 0-1 percentage scales, percentage coefficients (bp) feature 1) clearly comprehendible interpretation and 2) equitable scales for comparison. The coefficient (bp) serves the two functions effectively and efficiently. It thus serves needs unserved by other indicators, such as raw coefficient (bw) and standardized beta.
