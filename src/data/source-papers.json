To improve out-of-distribution (OOD) detection for segmentation, we introduce a metacognitive approach in the form of a lightweight module that leverages entropy measures, segmentation predictions, and spatial context to characterize the segmentation model's uncertainty and detect pixel-wise OOD data in real-time. Additionally, our approach incorporates a novel method of generating synthetic OOD data in context with in-distribution data, which we use to fine-tune existing segmentation models with maximum entropy training. This further improves the metacognitive module's performance without requiring access to OOD data while enabling compatibility with established pre-trained models. Our resulting approach can reliably detect OOD instances in a scene, as shown by state-of-the-art performance on OOD detection for semantic segmentation benchmarks.","creator":"Meghna Gummadi, Cassandra Kent, Karl Schmeckpeper, Eric Eaton"},{"id":"2311.07579","slug":"relative-intrinsic-dimensionality-is-intrinsic-to-learning-arxiv-2311-07579v1-cs-lg","title":"Relative intrinsic dimensionality is intrinsic to learning.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07579","abstract":"High dimensional data can have a surprising property: pairs of data points may be easily separated from each other, or even from arbitrary subsets, with high probability using just simple linear classifiers.

Here, we introduce a new notion of the intrinsic dimension of a data distribution, which precisely captures the separability properties of the data. For this intrinsic dimension, the rule of thumb above becomes a law: high intrinsic dimension guarantees highly separable data. We extend this notion to that of the relative intrinsic dimension of two data distributions, which we show provides both upper and lower bounds on the probability of successfully learning and generalising in a binary classification problem","creator":"Oliver J.

Vertical federated learning (VFL) is a promising solution to this kind of problem. It protects both the user's input and the knowledge of the model by splitting the model into a bottom part and a top part, which is maintained by the user and the model provider, respectively. However, in this paper, we demonstrate that in LLMs, VFL fails to protect the user input since it is simple and cheap to reconstruct the input from the intermediate embeddings.

Based on these rules, events are detected through batch processing using the Apache Jena framework. Based on the event detected, queries can be directly processed using SPARQL. To make the ontology operational, these Decision Tree (DT) rules are converted into Semantic Web Rule Language (SWRL).

This is in stark contrast to the vast majority of similar learning applications, for which the practice of machine learning suggests that (a) neural network-based models are typically state-of-the-art, and (b) strict standardization on evaluation procedures (datasets, metrics, etc.) is crucial. Thus motivated, we first propose a choice model that is the first to successfully (both theoretically and practically) leverage a modern neural network architectural concept (self-attention). Theoretically, we show that our attention-based choice model is a low-rank generalization of the Halo Multinomial Logit model, a recent model that parsimoniously captures irrational choice effects and has seen empirical success. We prove that whereas the Halo-MNL requires $\\Omega(m^2)$ data samples to estimate, where $m$ is the number of products, our model supports a natural nonconvex estimator (in particular, that which a standard neural network implementation would apply) which admits a near-optimal stationary point with $O(m)$ samples.

Here, we perform a critical inquiry into this claim by evaluating the mathematical understanding of the GPT-4 model. Considering that GPT-4's training set is a secret, it is not straightforward to evaluate whether the model's correct answers are based on a mathematical understanding or based on replication of proofs that the model has seen before. We specifically craft mathematical questions which their formal proofs are not readily available on the web, proofs that are more likely not seen by the GPT-4. We see that GPT-4 is unable to solve those problems despite their simplicity. It is hard to find scientific evidence suggesting that GPT-4 has acquired an understanding of even basic mathematical concepts. A straightforward way to find failure modes of GPT-4 in theorem proving is to craft questions where their formal proofs are not available on the web. Our finding suggests that GPT-4's ability is to reproduce, rephrase, and polish the mathematical proofs that it has seen before, and not in grasping mathematical concepts.

Although it is not feasible for an attacker to succeed with completely zero knowledge, we assume that the attacker only knows a short (or a few seconds) speech sample of a target speaker. Without any probing to gain further knowledge about the target model, we propose a new mechanism, called parrot training, to generate AEs against the target model.

We first design a skills network similar to the cerebellum by utilizing the selection mechanism of voluntary movements in the basal ganglia and the regulatory ability of the cerebellum to regulate movement. Subsequently, by imitating the structure of advanced centers in the motion system, we propose a high-level policy to generate different skill combinations, thereby enabling the robot to acquire natural motor abilities.

Its evaluation not only measures the correctness of the answer, but also the answer's verifiability, i.e., how well the answer is supported by the corresponding documents. In typical, verifiable generation adopts the retrieval-read pipeline, which is divided into two stages: 1) retrieve relevant documents of the question. 2) according to the documents, generate the corresponding answer. Since the retrieved documents can supplement knowledge for the LLM to generate the answer and serve as evidence, the retrieval stage is essential for the correctness and verifiability of the answer. However, the widely used retrievers become the bottleneck of the entire pipeline and limit the overall performance. They often have fewer parameters than the large language model and have not been proven to scale well to the size of LLMs. Since the LLM passively receives the retrieval result, if the retriever does not correctly find the supporting documents, the LLM can not generate the correct and verifiable answer, which overshadows the LLM's remarkable abilities. In this paper, we propose LLatrieval (Large Language Model Verified Retrieval), where the LLM updates the retrieval result until it verifies that the retrieved documents can support answering the question. Thus, the LLM can iteratively provide feedback to retrieval and facilitate the retrieval result to sufficiently support verifiable generation.

Our approach addresses critical limitations of both end-to-end reinforcement learning methods, which suffer from memory decay over long-horizon tasks, and traditional map-based methods that neglect visibility constraints. Our experiments, involving the first phase of the OVMM 2023 challenge, demonstrate that an agent equipped with POLoNet significantly outperforms a range of baseline methods, including end-to-end RL techniques and prior map-based strategies. To provide a comprehensive evaluation, we introduce new performance metrics that offer insights into the efficiency and effectiveness of various agents in object goal navigation.","creator":"Jiaming Wang, Harold Soh"},{"id":"2311.08000","slug":"lipar-a-lightweight-parallel-learning-model-for-practical-in-vehicle-network-intrusion-detection-arxiv-2311-08000v1-cs-cr","title":"LiPar: A Lightweight Parallel Learning Model for Practical In-Vehicle Network Intrusion Detection.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08000","abstract":"With the development of intelligent transportation systems, vehicles are exposed to a complex network environment.

Therefore, we have designed an imputation method that considers feature importance. This algorithm iteratively performs matrix completion and feature importance learning, and specifically, matrix completion is based on a filling loss that incorporates feature importance.

One of the first generalized ways in which deep learning models were able to solve verbal analogies was through vector arithmetic of word embeddings, essentially relating words that were mapped to a vector space (e.g., king - man + woman = __?). In comparison, most attempts to solve visual analogies are still predominantly task-specific and less generalizable. This project focuses on visual analogical reasoning and applies the initial generalized mechanism used to solve verbal analogies to the visual realm. Taking the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC) as an example to investigate visual analogy solving, we use a variational autoencoder (VAE) to transform ARC items into low-dimensional latent vectors, analogous to the word embeddings used in the verbal approaches. Through simple vector arithmetic, underlying rules of ARC items are discovered and used to solve them. Results indicate that the approach works well on simple items with fewer dimensions (i.e., few colors used, uniform shapes), similar input-to-output examples, and high reconstruction accuracy on the VAE. Predictions on more complex items showed stronger deviations from expected outputs, although, predictions still often approximated parts of the item's rule set. Error patterns indicated that the model works as intended. On the official ARC paradigm, the model achieved a score of 2% (cf. current world record is 21%) and on ConceptARC it scored 8.8%. Although the methodology proposed involves basic dimensionality reduction techniques and standard vector arithmetic, this approach demonstrates promising outcomes on ARC and can easily be generalized to other abstract visual reasoning tasks.","creator":"Luca H.

This paper proposes a new trajectory prediction model: CPSOR-GCN, which predicts vehicle trajectories under abnormal emotions. At the physical level, the interaction features between vehicles are extracted by the physical GCN module. At the cognitive level, SOR cognitive theory is used as prior knowledge to build a Dynamic Bayesian Network (DBN) structure. The conditional probability and state transition probability of nodes from the calibrated SOR-DBN quantify the causal relationship between cognitive factors, which is embedded into the cognitive GCN module to extract the characteristics of the influence mechanism of emotions on driving behavior. The CARLA-SUMO joint driving simulation platform was built to develop dangerous pre-crash scenarios. Methods of recreating traffic scenes were used to naturally induce abnormal emotions. The experiment collected data from 26 participants to verify the proposed model. Compared with the model that only considers physical motion features, the prediction accuracy of the proposed model is increased by 68.70%. Furthermore,considering the SOR-DBN reduces the prediction error of the trajectory by 15.93%. Compared with other advanced trajectory prediction models, the results of CPSOR-GCN also have lower errors. This model can be integrated into active safety systems to better adapt to the driver's emotions, which could effectively reduce false alarms.","creator":"L. Tang, Y. Li, J. Yuan, A. Fu, J.

The framework uses the Transformer encoder as an integral part of the model. We also introduce a novel data augmentation technique called abstract syntax tree transformation: This technique applies syntactic and semantic transformations to the original code snippets to generate more diverse and robust anchor samples. Our proposed framework is both flexible and adaptable: It can be easily extended to other downstream tasks that require code representation such as code clone detection and classification. The framework is also very efficient and scalable: It does not require a large model or a large amount of training data, and can support any programming language.Finally, our framework is not limited to unsupervised learning, but can also be applied to some supervised learning tasks by incorporating task-specific labels or objectives. To explore the effectiveness of our framework, we conducted extensive experiments on different software engineering tasks using different programming languages and multiple datasets.","creator":"Zixiang Xian, Rubing Huang, Dave Towey, Chunrong Fang, Zhenyu Chen"},{"id":"2311.08166","slug":"mechagents-large-language-model-multi-agent-collaborations-can-solve-mechanics-problems-generate-new-data-and-integrate-knowledge-arxiv-2311-08166v1-cs-ai","title":"MechAgents: Large language model multi-agent collaborations can solve mechanics problems, generate new data, and integrate knowledge.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08166","abstract":"Solving mechanics problems using numerical methods requires comprehensive intelligent capability of retrieving relevant knowledge and theory, constructing and executing codes, analyzing the results, a task that has thus far mainly been reserved for humans.

By leveraging diverse capabilities of multiple dynamically interacting large language models (LLMs), we can overcome the limitations of conventional approaches and develop a new class of physics-inspired generative machine learning platform, here referred to as MechAgents. A set of AI agents can solve mechanics tasks, here demonstrated for elasticity problems, via autonomous collaborations. A two-agent team can effectively write, execute and self-correct code, in order to apply finite element methods to solve classical elasticity problems in various flavors (different boundary conditions, domain geometries, meshes, small/finite deformation and linear/hyper-elastic constitutive laws, and others). For more complex tasks, we construct a larger group of agents with enhanced division of labor among planning, formulating, coding, executing and criticizing the process and results. The agents mutually correct each other to improve the overall team-work performance in understanding, formulating and validating the solution.

To date, the majority of the deep learning-based registration methods employ regularizers that enforce global spatial smoothness, e.g., the diffusion regularizer. However, such regularizers are not tailored to the data and might not be capable of reflecting the complex underlying deformation. In contrast, physics-inspired regularizers promote physically plausible deformations. One such regularizer is the linear elastic regularizer which models the deformation of elastic material. These regularizers are driven by parameters that define the material's physical properties. For biological tissue, a wide range of estimations of such parameters can be found in the literature and it remains an open challenge to identify suitable parameter values for successful registration. To overcome this problem and to incorporate physical properties into learning-based registration, we propose to use a hypernetwork that learns the effect of the physical parameters of a physics-inspired regularizer on the resulting spatial deformation field.

Activation maximization is used to synthesize inherently interpretable visual representations of the information encoded in individual neurons.

In this work, we take a closer look at how features are encoded in such pre-trained representations. We find that learned representations in a given layer exhibit a degree of diffuse redundancy, ie, any randomly chosen subset of neurons in the layer that is larger than a threshold size shares a large degree of similarity with the full layer and is able to perform similarly as the whole layer on a variety of downstream tasks. For example, a linear probe trained on $20\\%$ of randomly picked neurons from the penultimate layer of a ResNet50 pre-trained on ImageNet1k achieves an accuracy within $5\\%$ of a linear probe trained on the full layer of neurons for downstream CIFAR10 classification. We conduct experiments on different neural architectures (including CNNs and Transformers) pre-trained on both ImageNet1k and ImageNet21k and evaluate a variety of downstream tasks taken from the VTAB benchmark. We find that the loss and dataset used during pre-training largely govern the degree of diffuse redundancy and the \"critical mass\" of neurons needed often depends on the downstream task, suggesting that there is a task-inherent redundancy-performance Pareto frontier. Our findings shed light on the nature of representations learned by pre-trained deep neural networks and suggest that entire layers might not be necessary to perform many downstream tasks.

To address this, we consider a student-teacher framework between two LLM agents and study if, when, and how the teacher should intervene with natural language explanations to improve the student's performance. Since communication is expensive, we define a budget such that the teacher only communicates explanations for a fraction of the data, after which the student should perform well on its own. We decompose the teaching problem along four axes: (1) if teacher's test time intervention improve student predictions, (2) when it is worth explaining a data point, (3) how the teacher should personalize explanations to better teach the student, and (4) if teacher explanations also improve students on future unexplained data. We first show that teacher LLMs can indeed intervene on student reasoning to improve their performance. Next, inspired by the Theory of Mind abilities of effective teachers, we propose building two few-shot mental models of the student. The first model defines an Intervention Function that simulates the utility of an intervention, allowing the teacher to intervene when this utility is the highest and improving student performance at lower budgets. The second model enables the teacher to personalize explanations for a particular student and outperform unpersonalized teachers.

So far, there are many practical algorithms, but without providing theoretical explanations on their efficiency. We define a novel parameter of the input instance, $g_k(G)$, the gap between the degeneracy bound and the size of the maximum $k$-plex in the given graph, and present an exact algorithm parameterized by this $g_k(G)$, which has a worst-case running time polynomial in the size of the input graph and exponential in $g_k(G)$. In real-world inputs, $g_k(G)$ is very small, usually bounded by $O(\\log{(|V|)})$, indicating that the algorithm runs in polynomial time.

The imputation-based approach employed by ImDiffusion leverages the information from neighboring values in the time series, enabling precise modeling of temporal and inter-correlated dependencies, reducing uncertainty in the data, thereby enhancing the robustness of the anomaly detection process.

Standard input devices predominantly have two DoFs, requiring time-consuming and cognitively demanding mode switches to select individual DoFs. Contemporary Adaptive DoF Mapping Controls (ADMCs) have shown to decrease the necessary number of mode switches but were up to now not able to significantly reduce the perceived workload. Users still bear the mental workload of incorporating abstract mode switching into their workflow. We address this by providing feed-forward multimodal feedback using updated recommendations of ADMC, allowing users to visually compare the current and the suggested mapping in real-time.

Both are compared in a Virtual Reality (VR) in-person study against a classic control method. Significant results for lowered task completion time, fewer mode switches, and reduced perceived workload conclusively establish that in combination with feedforward, ADMC methods can indeed outperform classic mode switching.

This paper explores how their underlying mechanics give rise to intelligent behaviors. Towards that end, we propose framing Transformer dynamics as movement through embedding space. Examining Transformers through this perspective reveals key insights, establishing a Theory of Transformers: 1) Intelligent behaviours map to paths in Embedding Space which, the Transformer random-walks through during inferencing. 2) LM training learns a probability distribution over all possible paths. `Intelligence' is learnt by assigning higher probabilities to paths representing intelligent behaviors. No learning can take place in-context; context only narrows the subset of paths sampled during decoding. 5) The Transformer is a self-mapping composition function, folding a context sequence into a context-vector such that it's proximity to a token-vector reflects its co-occurrence and conditioned probability. Thus, the physical arrangement of vectors in Embedding Space determines path probabilities. 6) Context vectors are composed by aggregating features of the sequence's tokens via a process we call the encoding walk. Attention contributes a - potentially redundant - association-bias to this process. 7) This process is comprised of two principal operation types: filtering (data independent) and aggregation (data dependent). This generalization unifies Transformers with other sequence models.

The second level has the teacher probabilities of sampled labels available in addition, which turns out to boost the convergence rate lower bound to ${{|{\\mathcal S}||{\\mathcal A}|}/{n}}$. However, under this second data acquisition protocol, minimizing a naive adaptation of the cross-entropy loss results in an asymptotically biased student. We overcome this limitation and achieve the fundamental limit by using a novel empirical variant of the squared error logit loss. The third level further equips the student with the soft labels (complete logits) on ${\\mathcal A}$ given every sampled input, thereby provably enables the student to enjoy a rate ${|{\\mathcal S}|}/{n}$ free of $|{\\mathcal A}|$. We find any Kullback-Leibler divergence minimizer to be optimal in the last case.

By removing the assumption that models must be pure, we can go beyond the usual Kripke semantics and study epistemic logics where the number of agents participating in a world can vary. This approach has been developed in a number of papers, with applications in fault-tolerant distributed computing where processes may crash during the execution of a system. A difficulty that arises is that subtle design choices in the definition of impure simplicial models can result in different axioms of the resulting logic. In this paper, we classify those design choices systematically, and axiomatize the corresponding logics.

Specifically, for the input from any modality, TEAL first discretizes it into a token sequence with the off-the-shelf tokenizer and embeds the token sequence into a joint embedding space with a learnable embedding matrix. MM-LLMs just need to predict the multi-modal tokens autoregressively as the textual LLMs do. Finally, the corresponding de-tokenizer is applied to generate the output in each modality based on the predicted token sequence. With the joint embedding space, TEAL enables the frozen LLMs to perform both understanding and generation tasks involving non-textual modalities, such as image and audio. Thus, the textual LLM can just work as an interface and maintain its high performance in textual understanding and generation.

This study investigates an interesting issue pertaining to the evaluation of LLMs, namely the substantial discrepancy in performance between multiple-choice questions and open-ended questions. Inspired by research on jailbreak attack patterns, we argue this is caused by mismatched generalization. That is, the LLM does not have a comprehensive understanding of the complex concept of safety. Instead, it only remembers what to answer for open-ended safety questions, which makes it unable to solve other forms of safety tests. We refer to this phenomenon as fake alignment and construct a comparative benchmark to empirically verify its existence in LLMs. Such fake alignment renders previous evaluation protocols unreliable. To address this, we introduce the Fake alIgNment Evaluation (FINE) framework and two novel metrics--Consistency Score (CS) and Consistent Safety Score (CSS), which jointly assess two complementary forms of evaluation to quantify fake alignment and obtain corrected performance estimates. Applying FINE to 14 widely-used LLMs reveals several models with purported safety are poorly aligned in practice.

In literature review, generative artificial intelligence has been shown to generate ship hulls; however, ship design is particularly difficult as the hull of a ship requires the consideration of many objectives. This paper presents a study on the generation of parametric ship hull designs using a parametric diffusion model that considers multiple objectives and constraints for the hulls. This denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) generates the tabular parametric design vectors of a ship hull for evaluation. In addition to a tabular DDPM, this paper details adding guidance to improve the quality of generated ship hull designs. By leveraging classifier guidance, the DDPM produced feasible parametric ship hulls that maintain the coverage of the initial training dataset of ship hulls with a 99.5% rate, a 149x improvement over random sampling of the design vector parameters across the design space. Parametric ship hulls produced with performance guidance saw an average of 91.4% reduction in wave drag coefficients and an average of a 47.9x relative increase in the total displaced volume of the hulls compared to the mean performance of the hulls in the training dataset. The use of a DDPM to generate parametric ship hulls can reduce design time by generating high-performing hull designs for future analysis.

Perturbing PB size by overproducing PHYB provoked a biphasic PIF5 response: while a moderate increase in PHYB enhanced PIF5 degradation, further elevating the PHYB level stabilized PIF5 by retaining more of it in enlarged PBs. Our results support a model in which PHYB condensation stabilizes PIF5 in PBs to counteract PIF5 degradation in the surrounding nucleoplasm, thereby enabling an environmentally sensitive counterbalancing mechanism to titrate nucleoplasmic PIF5 and its transcriptional output. This PB-enabled signaling mechanism provides a framework for regulating a plethora of PHYB-interacting signaling molecules in diverse plant environmental responses. We propose that this function of PBs represents a general function of biomolecular condensates to allow distinct variations of a cellular process or signaling pathway to coexist and interact to generate dynamically adjustable integrated outputs within a single subcellular space.","creator":"Kim, R.

This study demonstrates the links of fluorescence and reflectance imaging with photosynthetic traits. Two wheat cultivars were grown in pots in a controlled environment. Photosynthesis was characterised by gas-exchange and biochemical analysis at five time points, from booting to 21 days post anthesis. On the same days imaging was performed on the same pots, at leaf and plant scale, using indoor and outdoor phenotyping platforms, respectively. Five image variables (Fv/Fm and NDVI at the whole plant level and Fv/Fm, {Phi}(II)532 and {Phi}(NPQ)1077 at the leaf scale) were compared to variables from A-Ci and A-Par curves, biochemical analysis, and fluorescence instruments. The results suggested that the image variables are robust estimators of photosynthetic traits, as long as senescence is driving the variability. Despite contrasting cultivar behaviour, linear regression models which account for the cultivar and the interaction effects, further improved the modelling of photosynthesis indicators. Finally, the results highlight the challenge of discriminating functional to cosmetic stay green genotypes using digital imaging.","creator":"Virlet, N., Pennacchi, J.

These include biochemical rate limitations, internal and external water potentials, temperature, irradiance, and carbon dioxide (CO2). Amphistomatous leaves have stomata on both abaxial and adaxial leaf surfaces. This feature is considered an adaptation to alleviate CO2 diffusion limitations in productive environments where other factors are not limiting as the diffusion path length from stomate to chloroplast is effectively halved. Plants can also reduce CO2 limitations through other aspects of optimal stomatal anatomy: stomatal density, distribution, patterning, and size. A number of studies have demonstrated that stomata are overdispersed on a single leaf surface; however, much less is known about stomatal anatomy in amphistomatous leaves, especially the coordination between leaf surfaces, despite their prevelance in nature and near ubiquity among crop species. Here we use novel spatial statistics based on simulations and photosynthesis modeling to test hypotheses about how amphistomatous plants may optimize CO2 limitations in the model angiosperm Arabidopsis thaliana grown in different light environments. We find that 1) stomata are overdispersed, but not ideally dispersed, on both leaf surfaces across all light treatments; 2) abaxial and adaxial leaf surface patterning are independent; and 3) the theoretical improvements to photosynthesis from abaxial-adaxial stomatal coordination are miniscule (<< 1%) across the range of feasible parameter space. However, we also find that 4) stomatal size is correlated with the mesophyll volume that it supplies with CO2, suggesting that plants may optimize CO2 diffusion limitations through alternative pathways other than ideal, uniform stomatal spacing. We discuss the developmental, physical, and evolutionary constraits which may prohibit plants from reaching the theoretical adaptive peak of uniform stomatal spacing and inter surface stomatal coordination.

We found that the FRET-based GPS2 biosensor detects exogenous GA treatments in maize, barley, sorghum, and wheat, in both vegetative and floral tissues. Measuring GPS2 output across GA dosages revealed tissue- and genotype-specific differences in GA sensor response. We observed marked differences in maize vs barley leaves and floral tissues and an unexpected drop in GPS2 output in the maize d1 GA biosynthesis mutant after GA treatment, likely reflecting differences in bioactive GA content, GA transport, and mechanisms of GA response. We then used RNAseq to measure transcriptional responses to GA treatment in leaves from maize wildtype, d1, and barley as well as floral tissues from maize and barley for a cross-tissue, cross-genotype, and cross-species GA-response comparison. After orthology prediction and analysis of within- and cross-species GO-term enrichment, we identified core sets of GA-responsive genes in each species as well as maize-barley orthogroups. Our analysis suggests that downregulation of GA-INSENSITIVE DWARF1 (GID1) and upregulation of -Expansin1 (EXPA1) orthologs comprises a universal GA-response mechanism that is independent of GA biosynthesis, and identifies F-Box proteins, hexokinase, and AMPK/SNF1 protein kinase orthologs as unexpected cross-tissue, cross-genotype, and cross-species GA-responsive genes.

However, how are C4/AC4 proteins transported to chloroplasts is unknown. We report here that the Coat Protein I (COPI) components play a critical role in redistributing Tomato yellow leaf curl virus (TYLCV) C4 protein to chloroplasts. TYLCV C4 interacts with the {beta} subunit of COPI, and the coexpression of both in Nicotiana benthamiana cells promotes the enrichment of C4 in chloroplasts, which also occurs during TYLCV infection and is blocked by an inhibitor of the COPI pathway. Overexpression of COPI components promotes but knockdown of gene expression inhibits TYLCV infection. The COPI pathway plays similar roles in C4/AC4 transport and infections of other geminiviruses, including Beet curly top virus and East African cassava mosaic virus.

Accordingly, CT measurements may provide a basis for high throughput assessments of the productivity of wheat canopies during early grain filling, which would allow distinguishing functional from dysfunctional stay-green. However, whereas the usefulness of CT as a fast surrogate measure of sustained vigor under soil drying is well established, its potential to quantify leaf activity traits under high-yielding conditions is less clear. To better understand sensitivity limits of CT measurements under high yielding conditions, we generated within-genotype variability in stay-green functionality by means of differential short-term pre-anthesis canopy shading that modified the sink:source balance. We quantified the effects of these modifications on stay-green properties through a combination of gold standard physiological measurements of leaf activity and newly developed methods for organ-level senescence monitoring based on timeseries of high-resolution imagery and deep-learning-based semantic image segmentation. In parallel, we monitored CT by means of a pole-mounted thermal camera that delivered continuous, ultra-high temporal resolution CT data. Our results show that differences in leaf activity stemming from differences in stay-green functionality translate into measurable differences in CT in the absence of major confounding factors. Differences amounted to approximately 0.8{degrees}C and 1.5{degrees}C for a very high-yielding source-limited genotype, and a medium-yielding sink-limited genotype, respectively. The gradual nature of the effects of shading on CT during the stay-green phase underscore the importance of a high measurement frequency and a time-integrated analysis of CT, whilst modest effect sizes confirm the importance of restricting screenings to a limited range of morphological and phenological diversity.","creator":"Anderegg, J., Kirchgessner, N., Aasen, H., Zumsteg, O., Keller, B., Zenkl, R., Walter, A., Hund, A."},{"id":"2023.11.08.566204v1","slug":"mobile-tuberigen-impacts-tuber-onset-synchronization-and-canopy-senescence-timing-in-potato","title":"Mobile tuberigen impacts tuber onset synchronization and canopy senescence timing in potato","link":"http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2023.11.08.566204v1?rss=1","abstract":"Yield of harvestable organs is a complex function of photosynthetic output, and sink-strength and timing of competing carbon sinks.

We find that SP6Ai results in a delay of approximately 2 weeks in tuber onset, yet has a 4-to-5-week delayed canopy senescence. Together this results in a prolonged tuber growth phase, with reduced synchronization in tuber onset and a resulting increased variance in tuber sizes, while overall final tuber fresh weight remains similar. Using a leaf and tuber growth model comparing various leaf senescence mechanisms, we find that resource competition, and not a shared signal for tuberization and senescence, is able to explain how delayed tuberization leads to further delayed senescence.

Natural variation exists for aphid HPR in sorghum (Sorghum bicolor) but the genetic architecture and phenotype has not been clarified for most sources. To assess the threat of a sorghum aphid (Melanaphis sorghi) biotype shift, we characterized the phenotype of Resistance to Melanaphis sorghi 1 (RMES1) and contributing HPR architecture in globally-admixed populations selected under severe aphid infestation in Haiti. We found RMES1 reduces sorghum aphid fecundity but not bird cherry-oat aphid (Rhopalosiphum padi) fecundity, suggesting a discriminant HPR response typical of gene-for-gene interaction. A second resistant gene, RMES2, were more frequent than RMES1 resistant alleles in landraces and historic breeding lines. RMES2 contributes early and mid-season aphid resistance in a segregating F2 population, however RMES1 was only significant with mid-season fitness. In a fixed population with high aphid resistance, RMES1 and RMES2 were selected for demonstrating a lack of significant antagonistic pleiotropy. Associations with resistance co-located with cyanogenic glucoside biosynthesis genes support additional HPR sources.

Yet, relatively little is known about how plants regulate the crosstalk between stress response pathways to trigger a coordinated response to combined stresses. Protein degradation by the ubiquitin/proteasome system (UPS) is central to the regulation of plant responses to multiple stresses, including the crosstalk between pathways. The Arg/N-degron pathway, a subset of the UPS, targets proteins based on their N-termini. In plants, it has been implicated in the responses to both biotic and abiotic stresses, while being a key regulator of hypoxia response through the degradation of ERF-VII transcription factors, which orchestrate the onset of the hypoxia response program. Because of its central position in regulating multiple (a)biotic stresses, we hypothesized that the Arg/N-degron pathway could act in the crosstalk between abiotic/biotic stresses. In exploring this possibility using the model pathogen-associated molecular pattern flg22 to elicit pattern-triggered immunity (PTI), we uncovered a link between the transcriptional response programs to hypoxia and to flg22. Combined hypoxia/flg22 treatments further showed that hypoxia represses the flg22 transcriptional program, as well as the expression of pattern recognition receptors, MAPK signalling and callose deposition during PTI, through mechanisms that are at least partly dependent on the ERF-VIIs. These findings are of relevance to understanding the trade-offs between plant responses to combined abiotic/biotic stresses in the context of our efforts to increase crop resilience to global climate change. Our results also show that the well-known repressive effect of hypoxia on innate immunity in animals also applies to plants.  Significance statementUnderstanding how plants regulate the crosstalk between stress response pathways is key to our efforts to increase crop resilience and mitigate yield losses caused by global climate change. Despite the urgency to do so, relatively little remains known about how plants respond to combined stresses, which frequently occur in nature. Here, we show that the hypoxia response program and the basal layer of plant immunity (pattern-triggered immunity or PTI) share components. Our data also show that hypoxia represses several key aspects of the plants innate immune response, a situation akin to that discovered in animals decades ago. These findings have implications for our ability to develop resilient crops by limiting the negative trade-offs that exist between hypoxia response and immunity.","creator":"Mooney, B. C., Doorly, C.

However, potential mitigating roles of habitat buffering on moss aridity exposure and stress resistance remain largely unexplored. We predicted the most buffered and healthiest biocrust mosses would occur in high-elevation forests on north-facing slopes beneath shrub canopies in the Mojave Desert.  MethodsWe located three life zone populations of a keystone biocrust moss, Syntrichia caninervis, spanning 1200-m of altitude in Nevada. We selected 96 microsites stratified by life zone and topography zone (aspect and hydrological position), and microhabitat type (shrub proximity). We quantified end-of-summer photosynthetic stress (Fv/Fm), and aridity at three scales: macroclimate, mesoscale exposure, and microscale shade time.  ResultsMoss habitat structure varied greatly across scales, revealing exposed and buffered microsites in all life zones. Moss stress did not differ by life zone despite the extensive macroclimate gradient but was lowest on N-facing slopes and microhabitats with higher shade, while the importance and interactions of topography, exposure, and shade varied by life zone.  ConclusionsOur findings support an emerging vulnerability paradigm for small dryland organisms: microrefugia may be more important than high-elevation macrorefugia for increasing resistance to climate stress. We demonstrate, for the first time, that multiple scales of interacting habitat structure appear to create physiologically significant buffered habitats for S. caninervis, which may allow this species to hide from the brunt of climate change in widespread microrefugia.","creator":"Clark, T.

In our setting, the sequence of realized states of nature may be adversarially chosen, the Agent is non-myopic, and the Principal aims for a strong form of policy regret. Following Camara, Hartline, and Johnson, we model the Agent's long-run behavior with behavioral assumptions that relax the common prior assumption (for example, that the Agent has no swap regret). Within this framework, we revisit the mechanism proposed by Camara et al., which informally uses calibrated forecasts of the unknown states of nature in place of a common prior. We give two main improvements. First, we give a mechanism that has an exponentially improved dependence (in terms of both running time and regret bounds) on the number of distinct states of nature. To do this, we show that our mechanism does not require truly calibrated forecasts, but rather forecasts that are unbiased subject to only a polynomially sized collection of events -- which can be produced with polynomial overhead. Second, in several important special cases -- including the focal linear contracting setting -- we show how to remove strong ``Alignment'' assumptions (which informally require that near-ties are always broken in favor of the Principal) by specifically deploying ``stable'' policies that do not have any near ties that are payoff relevant to the Principal.

Finally, based on evidence from records on occupations and educational attainments, we argue that the observed decline in intergenerational mobility is consistent with female skills becoming increasingly valued in the labor market.","creator":"Ulrika Ahrsj&#xf6;, Ren&#xe9; Karadakic, Joachim Kahr Rasmussen"},{"id":"2309.12945","slug":"the-micro-aggregated-profit-share-arxiv-2309-12945v3-econ-gn-updated","title":"The Micro-Aggregated Profit Share.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.12945","abstract":"How much has market power increased in the United States in the last fifty years? And how did the rise in market power affect aggregate profits? Using micro-level data from U.S. Compustat, we find that several indicators of market power have steadily increased since 1970. In particular, the aggregate markup has gone up from 10% of price over marginal cost in 1970 to 23% in 2020, and aggregate returns to scale have risen from 1.00 to 1.13. We connect these market-power indicators to profitability by showing that the aggregate profit share can be expressed in terms of the aggregate markup, aggregate returns to scale, and a sufficient statistic for production networks that captures double marginalization in the economy. We find that despite the rise in market power, the profit share has been constant at 18% of GDP because the increase in monopoly rents has been completely offset by rising fixed costs and changes in technology. Our empirical results have subtle implications for policymakers: overly aggressive enforcement of antitrust law could decrease firm dynamism and paradoxically lead to lower competition and higher market power.","creator":"Thomas Hasenzagl, Luis Perez"}]}]
