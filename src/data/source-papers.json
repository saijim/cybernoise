        "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.00627",
        "abstract": "Previous brain decoding research primarily involves single-subject studies, reconstructing stimuli via fMRI activity from the same subject. Our study aims to introduce a generalization technique for cross-subject brain decoding, facilitated by exploring data alignment methods. We utilized the NSD dataset, a comprehensive 7T fMRI vision experiment involving multiple subjects exposed to 9841 images, 982 of which were viewed by all. Our approach involved training a decoding model on one subject, aligning others' data to this space, and testing the decoding on the second subject. We compared ridge regression, hyper alignment, and anatomical alignment techniques for fMRI data alignment. We established that cross-subject brain decoding is feasible, even using around 10% of the total data, or 982 common images, with comparable performance to single-subject decoding. Ridge regression was the best method for functional alignment. Through subject alignment, we achieved superior brain decoding and a potential 90% reduction in scan time. This could pave the way for more efficient experiments and further advancements in the field, typically requiring an exorbitant 20-hour scan time per subject.",

        "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.00638",
        "abstract": "Developing a generative model of realistic order flow in financial markets is a challenging open problem, with numerous applications for market participants. Addressing this, we propose the first end-to-end autoregressive generative model that generates tokenized limit order book (LOB) messages. These messages are interpreted by a Jax-LOB simulator, which updates the LOB state. To handle long sequences efficiently, the model employs simplified structured state-space layers to process sequences of order book states and tokenized messages. Using LOBSTER data of NASDAQ equity LOBs, we develop a custom tokenizer for message data, converting groups of successive digits to tokens, similar to tokenization in large language models. Out-of-sample results show promising performance in approximating the data distribution, as evidenced by low model perplexity. Furthermore, the mid-price returns calculated from the generated order flow exhibit a significant correlation with the data, indicating impressive conditional forecast performance. Due to the granularity of generated data, and the accuracy of the model, it offers new application areas for future work beyond forecasting, e.g. acting as a world model in high-frequency financial reinforcement learning applications. Overall, our results invite the use and extension of the model in the direction of autoregressive large financial models for the generation of high-frequency financial data and we commit to open-sourcing our code to facilitate future research.",

Most prominent theories of consciousness, both scientific and metaphysical, argue for different kinds of information coupling as a necessary component of human-like consciousness. By comparing information coupling in human and animal brains, human cognitive development, emergent abilities, and mental representation development to analogous phenomena in large language models, I argue that psychometric measures of intelligence, such as the g-factor or IQ, indirectly approximate the extent of conscious experience.  Based on a broader source of both scientific and metaphysical theories of consciousness, I argue that all systems possess a degree of consciousness ascertainable psychometrically and that psychometric measures of intelligence may be used to gauge relative similarities of conscious experiences across disparate systems, be they artificial or human.",

Synthetic data can be a powerful instrument for protecting the privacy of individuals, but it also presents challenges, such as ensuring its quality and authenticity. A well crafted synthetic data policy must strike a balance between privacy concerns and the utility of data, ensuring that it can be utilized effectively without compromising ethical or legal standards.

CDARTS is a Differentiable Architecture Search (DARTS)-based approach to neural architecture search (NAS) that uses a cyclic feedback mechanism to train search and evaluation networks concurrently. This training protocol aims to optimize the search process by enforcing that the search and evaluation networks produce similar outputs. However, CDARTS introduces a loss function for the evaluation network that is dependent on the search network. The dissimilarity between the loss functions used by the evaluation networks during the search and retraining phases results in a search-phase evaluation network that is a sub-optimal proxy for the final evaluation network that is utilized during retraining. We present ICDARTS, a revised approach that eliminates the dependency of the evaluation network weights upon those of the search network, along with a modified process for discretizing the search network's \\textit{zero} operations that allows these operations to be retained in the final evaluation networks. We pair the results of these changes with ablation studies on ICDARTS' algorithm and network template. Finally, we explore methods for expanding the search space of ICDARTS by expanding its operation set and exploring alternate methods for discretizing its continuous search cells. These experiments resulted in networks with improved generalizability and the implementation of a novel method for incorporating a dynamic search space into ICDARTS.",

        "abstract": "Federated and Continual Learning have emerged as potential paradigms for the robust and privacy-aware use of Deep Learning in dynamic environments. However, Client Drift and Catastrophic Forgetting are fundamental obstacles to guaranteeing consistent performance. Existing work only addresses these problems separately, which neglects the fact that the root cause behind both forms of performance deterioration is connected. We propose a unified analysis framework for building a controlled test environment for Client Drift -- by perturbing a defined ratio of clients -- and Catastrophic Forgetting -- by shifting all clients with a particular strength. Our framework further leverages this new combined analysis by generating a 3D landscape of the combined performance impact from both. We demonstrate that the performance drop through Client Drift, caused by a certain share of shifted clients, is correlated to the drop from Catastrophic Forgetting resulting from a corresponding shift strength. Correlation tests between both problems for Computer Vision (CelebA) and Medical Imaging (PESO) support this new perspective, with an average Pearson rank correlation coefficient of over 0.94. Our framework's novel ability of combined spatio-temporal shift analysis allows us to investigate how both forms of distribution shift behave in mixed scenarios, opening a new pathway for better generalization. We show that a combination of moderate Client Drift and Catastrophic Forgetting can even improve the performance of the resulting model (causing a \"Generalization Bump\") compared to when only one of the shifts occurs individually. We apply a simple and commonly used method from Continual Learning in the federated setting and observe this phenomenon to be reoccurring, leveraging the ability of our framework to analyze existing and novel methods for Federated and Continual Learning.",

A key element of effective simulation is the incorporation of realistic traffic models that align with human knowledge, an aspect that has proven challenging due to the need to balance realism and diversity. This works aims to address this by developing a framework that employs reinforcement learning with human preference (RLHF) to enhance the realism of existing traffic models. This study also identifies two main challenges: capturing the nuances of human preferences on realism and the unification of diverse traffic simulation models. To tackle these issues, we propose using human feedback for alignment and employ RLHF due to its sample efficiency. We also introduce the first dataset for realism alignment in traffic modeling to support such research. Our framework, named TrafficRLHF, demonstrates its proficiency in generating realistic traffic scenarios that are well-aligned with human preferences, as corroborated by comprehensive evaluations on the nuScenes dataset.",

We propose to leverage prompts for a LLM without fine tuning during rescoring which incorporate a biasing list and few-shot examples to serve as additional information when calculating the score for the hypothesis. In addition to few-shot prompt learning, we propose multi-task training of the LLM to predict both the entity class and the next token. To improve the efficiency for contextual biasing and to avoid exceeding LLMs' maximum sequence lengths, we propose dynamic prompting, where we select the most likely class using the class tag prediction, and only use entities in this class as contexts for next token prediction. Word Error Rate (WER) evaluation is performed on i) an internal calling, messaging, and dictation dataset, and ii) the SLUE-Voxpopuli dataset. Results indicate that biasing lists and few-shot examples can achieve 17.8% and 9.6% relative improvement compared to first pass ASR, and that multi-task training and dynamic prompting can achieve 20.0% and 11.3% relative WER improvement, respectively.",

It injects a small number of poisoned images with the correct label into the training data, which makes the attack hard to be detected. To craft the poisoned images, we first propose the confusing perturbations to disturb the hashing code learning. As such, the hashing model can learn more about the trigger. The confusing perturbations are imperceptible and generated by optimizing the intra-class dispersion and inter-class shift in the Hamming space. We then employ the targeted adversarial patch as the backdoor trigger to improve the attack performance. We have conducted extensive experiments to verify the effectiveness of our proposed CIBA.

Motivated by behavioral testing, we create a semi-synthetic large test bench (363 templates, 363k examples) and an associated framework that offers the following utilities: 1) individually test and analyze reasoning capabilities along 17 reasoning dimensions (including pragmatic reasoning); 2) design experiments to study cross-capability information content (leave one out or bring one in); and 3) the synthetic nature enables us to control for artifacts and biases. We extend a publicly available framework of automated test case instantiation from free-form natural language templates (CheckList) and a well-defined taxonomy of capabilities to cover a wide range of increasingly harder test cases while varying the complexity of natural language. Through our analysis of state-of-the-art NLI systems, we observe that our benchmark is indeed hard (and non-trivial even with training on additional resources). Some capabilities stand out as harder. Further, fine-grained analysis and fine-tuning experiments reveal more insights about these capabilities and the models -- supporting and extending previous observations; thus showing the utility of the proposed testbench.",

This integration has sparked a surge in paradigm transfer, which is solving one molecular learning task by reformulating it as another one. With the emergence of Large Language Models, these paradigms have demonstrated an escalating trend towards harmonized unification. In this work, we delineate a literature survey focused on knowledge-informed molecular learning from the perspective of paradigm transfer. We classify the paradigms, scrutinize their methodologies, and dissect the contribution of domain knowledge.

        "abstract": "Transformers have emerged as the state of the art neural network architecture for natural language processing and computer vision. In the foundation model paradigm, large transformer models (BERT, GPT3/4, Bloom, ViT) are pre-trained on self-supervised tasks such as word or image masking, and then, adapted through fine-tuning for downstream user applications including instruction following and Question Answering. While many approaches have been developed for model fine-tuning including low-rank weight update strategies (eg. LoRA), underlying mathematical principles that enable network adaptation without knowledge loss remain poorly understood. Here, we introduce a differential geometry framework, functionally invariant paths (FIP), that provides flexible and continuous adaptation of neural networks for a range of machine learning goals and network sparsification objectives. We conceptualize the weight space of a neural network as a curved Riemannian manifold equipped with a metric tensor whose spectrum defines low rank subspaces in weight space that accommodate network adaptation without loss of prior knowledge. We formalize adaptation as movement along a geodesic path in weight space while searching for networks that accommodate secondary objectives. With modest computational resources, the FIP algorithm achieves comparable to state of the art performance on continual learning and sparsification tasks for language models (BERT), vision transformers (ViT, DeIT), and the CNNs. Broadly, we conceptualize a neural network as a mathematical object that can be iteratively transformed into distinct configurations by the path-sampling algorithm to define a sub-manifold of weight space that can be harnessed to achieve user goals.",

        "abstract": "This paper proposes an introspective deep metric learning (IDML) framework for uncertainty-aware comparisons of images. Conventional deep metric learning methods produce confident semantic distances between images regardless of the uncertainty level. However, we argue that a good similarity model should consider the semantic discrepancies with caution to better deal with ambiguous images for more robust training. To achieve this, we propose to represent an image using not only a semantic embedding but also an accompanying uncertainty embedding, which describes the semantic characteristics and ambiguity of an image, respectively. We further propose an introspective similarity metric to make similarity judgments between images considering both their semantic differences and ambiguities. The proposed IDML framework improves the performance of deep metric learning through uncertainty modeling and attains state-of-the-art results on the widely used CUB-200-2011, Cars196, and Stanford Online Products datasets for image retrieval and clustering.

        "abstract": "Deep Learning (DL) is increasingly used in safety-critical applications, raising concerns about its reliability. DL suffers from a well-known problem of lacking robustness, especially when faced with adversarial perturbations known as Adversarial Examples (AEs). Despite recent efforts to detect AEs using advanced attack and testing methods, these approaches often overlook the input distribution and perceptual quality of the perturbations. As a result, the detected AEs may not be relevant in practical applications or may appear unrealistic to human observers. This can waste testing resources on rare AEs that seldom occur during real-world use, limiting improvements in DL model dependability.  In this paper, we propose a new robustness testing approach for detecting AEs that considers both the feature level distribution and the pixel level distribution, capturing the perceptual quality of adversarial perturbations. The two considerations are encoded by a novel hierarchical mechanism. First, we select test seeds based on the density of feature level distribution and the vulnerability of adversarial robustness. The vulnerability of test seeds are indicated by the auxiliary information, that are highly correlated with local robustness. Given a test seed, we then develop a novel genetic algorithm based local test case generation method, in which two fitness functions work alternatively to control the perceptual quality of detected AEs. Finally, extensive experiments confirm that our holistic approach considering hierarchical distributions is superior to the state-of-the-arts that either disregard any input distribution or only consider a single (non-hierarchical) distribution, in terms of not only detecting imperceptible AEs but also improving the overall robustness of the DL model under testing.",

The dataset contains 54,000 artificially generated trades with 22 key attributes, and it is synthesized with conditional tabular GAN while maintaining correlated features. Synthetic data has several advantages. First, releasing the dataset is free from restrictions that do not allow disclosing the original import data. The fabrication step minimizes the possible identity risk which may exist in trade statistics. Second, the published data follow a similar distribution to the source data so that it can be used in various downstream tasks. Hence, our dataset can be used as a benchmark for testing the performance of any classification algorithm.

In this work, we show that existing symbolic operator learning approaches fall short in many robotics domains where a robot's actions tend to cause a large number of irrelevant changes in the abstract state. This is primarily because they attempt to learn operators that exactly predict all observed changes in the abstract state. To overcome this issue, we propose to learn operators that 'choose what to predict' by only modelling changes necessary for abstract planning to achieve specified goals. Experimentally, we show that our approach learns operators that lead to efficient planning across 10 different hybrid robotics domains, including 4 from the challenging BEHAVIOR-100 benchmark, while generalizing to novel initial states, goals, and objects.",

        "abstract": "Data-driven evolutionary algorithms usually aim to exploit the information behind a limited amount of data to perform optimization, which have proved to be successful in solving many complex real-world optimization problems. However, most data-driven evolutionary algorithms are centralized, causing privacy and security concerns. Existing federated Bayesian algorithms and data-driven evolutionary algorithms mainly protect the raw data on each client. To address this issue, this paper proposes a secure federated data-driven evolutionary multi-objective optimization algorithm to protect both the raw data and the newly infilled solutions obtained by optimizing the acquisition function conducted on the server. We select the query points on a randomly selected client at each round of surrogate update by calculating the acquisition function values of the unobserved points on this client, thereby reducing the risk of leaking the information about the solution to be sampled. In addition, since the predicted objective values of each client may contain sensitive information, we mask the objective values with Diffie-Hellmann-based noise, and then send only the masked objective values of other clients to the selected client via the server. Since the calculation of the acquisition function also requires both the predicted objective value and the uncertainty of the prediction, the predicted mean objective and uncertainty are normalized to reduce the influence of noise. Experimental results on a set of widely used multi-objective optimization benchmarks show that the proposed algorithm can protect privacy and enhance security with only negligible sacrifice in the performance of federated data-driven evolutionary optimization.",

A better understanding of the needs of XAI users, as well as human-centered evaluations of explainable models are both a necessity and a challenge. In this paper, we explore how HCI and AI researchers conduct user studies in XAI applications based on a systematic literature review. After identifying and thoroughly analyzing 97core papers with human-based XAI evaluations over the past five years, we categorize them along the measured characteristics of explanatory methods, namely trust, understanding, usability, and human-AI collaboration performance. Our research shows that XAI is spreading more rapidly in certain application domains, such as recommender systems than in others, but that user evaluations are still rather sparse and incorporate hardly any insights from cognitive or social sciences. Based on a comprehensive discussion of best practices, i.e., common models, design choices, and measures in user studies, we propose practical guidelines on designing and conducting user studies for XAI researchers and practitioners. Lastly, this survey also highlights several open research directions, particularly linking psychological science and human-centered XAI.",

        "abstract": "We present a scalable strategy for development of mesh-free hybrid neuro-symbolic partial differential equation solvers based on existing mesh-based numerical discretization methods. Particularly, this strategy can be used to efficiently train neural network surrogate models of partial differential equations by (i) leveraging the accuracy and convergence properties of advanced numerical methods, solvers, and preconditioners, as well as (ii) better scalability to higher order PDEs by strictly limiting optimization to first order automatic differentiation. The presented neural bootstrapping method (hereby dubbed NBM) is based on evaluation of the finite discretization residuals of the PDE system obtained on implicit Cartesian cells centered on a set of random collocation points with respect to trainable parameters of the neural network. Importantly, the conservation laws and symmetries present in the bootstrapped finite discretization equations inform the neural network about solution regularities within local neighborhoods of training points. We apply NBM to the important class of elliptic problems with jump conditions across irregular interfaces in three spatial dimensions. We show the method is convergent such that model accuracy improves by increasing number of collocation points in the domain and predonditioning the residuals. We show NBM is competitive in terms of memory and training speed with other PINN-type frameworks. The algorithms presented here are implemented using \\texttt{JAX} in a software package named \\texttt{JAX-DIPS} (https://github.com/JAX-DIPS/JAX-DIPS), standing for differentiable interfacial PDE solver.

        "abstract": "While Nash equilibrium has emerged as the central game-theoretic solution concept, many important games contain several Nash equilibria and we must determine how to select between them in order to create real strategic agents. Several Nash equilibrium refinement concepts have been proposed and studied for sequential imperfect-information games, the most prominent being trembling-hand perfect equilibrium, quasi-perfect equilibrium, and recently one-sided quasi-perfect equilibrium. These concepts are robust to certain arbitrarily small mistakes, and are guaranteed to always exist; however, we argue that neither of these is the correct concept for developing strong agents in sequential games of imperfect information. We define a new equilibrium refinement concept for extensive-form games called observable perfect equilibrium in which the solution is robust over trembles in publicly-observable action probabilities (not necessarily over all action probabilities that may not be observable by opposing players). Observable perfect equilibrium correctly captures the assumption that the opponent is playing as rationally as possible given mistakes that have been observed (while previous solution concepts do not). We prove that observable perfect equilibrium is always guaranteed to exist, and demonstrate that it leads to a different solution than the prior extensive-form refinements in no-limit poker. We expect observable perfect equilibrium to be a useful equilibrium refinement concept for modeling many important imperfect-information games of interest in artificial intelligence.",

HCNet uses a multi-hash codebook as the main memory place and the whole memory procedure consists of three phases: multi-hash addressing, memory restoring, and feature shrinking. We also propose a new CTR model named MemoNet which combines HCNet with a DNN backbone. Extensive experimental results on three public datasets and online test show that MemoNet reaches superior performance over state-of-the-art approaches. Besides, MemoNet shows scaling law of large language model in NLP, which means we can enlarge the size of the codebook in HCNet to sustainably obtain performance gains.

We use the encoder of a sequence-to-sequence architecture, trained on visually different but mathematically equivalent expressions, to generate vector representations (or embeddings).

However, it is beyond the capabilities of existing approaches due to the highly intractable nature of the embedded probabilistic inference. Prior works spend most of the training time learning to separate valid from invalid structures but do not learn the inductive biases of valid structures. We develop NEural Lov\\'asz Sampler (Nelson), which embeds the sampler through Lov\\'asz Local Lemma (LLL) as a fully differentiable neural network layer. Our Nelson-CD embeds this sampler into the contrastive divergence learning process of Markov random fields. Nelson allows us to obtain valid samples from the current model distribution. Contrastive divergence is then applied to separate these samples from those in the training set. Nelson is implemented as a fully differentiable neural net, taking advantage of the parallelism of GPUs. Experimental results on several real-world domains reveal that Nelson learns to generate 100\\% valid structures, while baselines either time out or cannot ensure validity. Nelson also outperforms other approaches in running time, log-likelihood, and MAP scores.",

Multiple approaches are proposed to accelerate attention mechanism, improve inefficient designs, or incorporate mobile-friendly lightweight convolutions to form hybrid architectures. However, ViT and its variants still have higher latency or considerably more parameters than lightweight CNNs, even true for the years-old MobileNet. In practice, latency and size are both crucial for efficient deployment on resource-constraint hardware. In this work, we investigate a central question, can transformer models run as fast as MobileNet and maintain a similar size? We revisit the design choices of ViTs and propose a novel supernet with low latency and high parameter efficiency. We further introduce a novel fine-grained joint search strategy for transformer models that can find efficient architectures by optimizing latency and number of parameters simultaneously. The proposed models, EfficientFormerV2, achieve 3.5% higher top-1 accuracy than MobileNetV2 on ImageNet-1K with similar latency and parameters.

Previous methods commonly regard manual annotations such as horizontal rectangles, rotated rectangles, quadrangles, and polygons as a prerequisite, which are much more expensive than using single-point. Our new framework, SPTS v2, allows us to train high-performing text-spotting models using a single-point annotation. SPTS v2 reserves the advantage of the auto-regressive Transformer with an Instance Assignment Decoder (IAD) through sequentially predicting the center points of all text instances inside the same predicting sequence, while with a Parallel Recognition Decoder (PRD) for text recognition in parallel, which significantly reduces the requirement of the length of the sequence. These two decoders share the same parameters and are interactively connected with a simple but effective information transmission process to pass the gradient and information. Comprehensive experiments on various existing benchmark datasets demonstrate the SPTS v2 can outperform previous state-of-the-art single-point text spotters with fewer parameters while achieving 19$\\times$ faster inference speed. Within the context of our SPTS v2 framework, our experiments suggest a potential preference for single-point representation in scene text spotting when compared to other representations.

A central challenge in this setting is backpropagation through the solution of an optimization problem, which typically lacks a closed form. One typical strategy is algorithm unrolling, which relies on automatic differentiation through the operations of an iterative solver. While flexible and general, unrolling can encounter accuracy and efficiency issues in practice. These issues can be avoided by analytical differentiation of the optimization, but current frameworks impose rigid requirements on the optimization problem's form. This paper provides theoretical insights into the backward pass of unrolled optimization, leading to a system for generating efficiently solvable analytical models of backpropagation. Additionally, it proposes a unifying view of unrolling and analytical differentiation through optimization mappings.

Nevertheless, wind power generation is characterized by volatility, intermittence, and randomness, which hinder its ability to serve as a reliable power source for the grid. Accurate wind power forecasting is crucial for developing a new power system that heavily relies on renewable energy sources. However, traditional wind power forecasting systems primarily focus on ultra-short-term or short-term forecasts, limiting their ability to address the diverse adjustment requirements of the power system simultaneously. To overcome these challenges, We propose an automatic framework capable of forecasting wind power across multi-time scale. The framework based on the tree-structured Parzen estimator (TPE) and temporal fusion transformer (TFT) that can provide ultra-short-term, short-term and medium-term wind power forecasting power.Our approach employs the TFT for wind power forecasting and categorizes features based on their properties. Additionally, we introduce a generic algorithm to simultaneously fine-tune the hyperparameters of the decomposition method and model.

        "abstract": "This paper examines the current landscape of AI regulations, highlighting the divergent approaches being taken, and proposes an alternative contextual, coherent, and commensurable (3C) framework. The EU, Canada, South Korea, and Brazil follow a horizontal or lateral approach that postulates the homogeneity of AI systems, seeks to identify common causes of harm, and demands uniform human interventions. In contrast, the U.K., Israel, Switzerland, Japan, and China have pursued a context-specific or modular approach, tailoring regulations to the specific use cases of AI systems. The U.S. is reevaluating its strategy, with growing support for controlling existential risks associated with AI. Addressing such fragmentation of AI regulations is crucial to ensure the interoperability of AI. The present degree of proportionality, granularity, and foreseeability of the EU AI Act is not sufficient to garner consensus. The context-specific approach holds greater promises but requires further development in terms of details, coherency, and commensurability. To strike a balance, this paper proposes a hybrid 3C framework. To ensure contextuality, the framework categorizes AI into distinct types based on their usage and interaction with humans: autonomous, allocative, punitive, cognitive, and generative AI. To ensure coherency, each category is assigned specific regulatory objectives: safety for autonomous AI; fairness and explainability for allocative AI; accuracy and explainability for punitive AI; accuracy, robustness, and privacy for cognitive AI; and the mitigation of infringement and misuse for generative AI. To ensure commensurability, the framework promotes the adoption of international industry standards that convert principles into quantifiable metrics. In doing so, the framework is expected to foster international collaboration and standardization without imposing excessive compliance costs.",

In this work, we propose to explore this problem based on a design approach. Starting from a small initial set of samples, we adaptively discover critical samples to achieve increasingly accurate learning of the system evolution. One central challenge here is that we do not know the network modeling error since the ground-truth system state is unknown, which is however needed for critical sampling. To address this challenge, we introduce a multi-step reciprocal prediction network where forward and backward evolution networks are designed to learn the temporal evolution behavior in the forward and backward time directions, respectively. Very interestingly, we find that the desired network modeling error is highly correlated with the multi-step reciprocal prediction error, which can be directly computed from the current system state. This allows us to perform a dynamic selection of critical samples from regions with high network modeling errors for dynamical systems. Additionally, a joint spatial-temporal evolution network is introduced which incorporates spatial dynamics modeling into the temporal evolution prediction for robust learning of the system evolution operator with few samples. Our extensive experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method is able to dramatically reduce the number of samples needed for effective learning and accurate prediction of evolution behaviors of unknown dynamical systems by up to hundreds of times.",

However, they often employ a single prompt to describe class contexts, failing to capture categories' diverse attributes adequately. This study introduces the Partitioned Multi-modal Prompt (PMPO), a multi-modal prompting technique that extends the soft prompt from a single learnable prompt to multiple prompts. Our method divides the visual encoder depths and connects learnable prompts to the separated visual depths, enabling different prompts to capture the hierarchical contextual depths of visual representations. Furthermore, to maximize the advantages of multi-prompt learning, we incorporate prior information from manually designed templates and learnable multi-prompts, thus improving the generalization capabilities of our approach. We evaluate the effectiveness of our approach on three challenging tasks: new class generalization, cross-dataset evaluation, and domain generalization. For instance, our method achieves a $79.28$ harmonic mean, averaged over 11 diverse image recognition datasets ($+7.62$ compared to CoOp), demonstrating significant competitiveness compared to state-of-the-art prompting methods.",

Of late, state-of-the-art Visual Question Answering (VQA) models have shown impressive performance on in-domain data, partially due to the language priors bias which, however, hinders the generalization ability in practice. This paper attempts to provide new insights into the influence of language modality on VQA performance from an empirical study perspective. To achieve this, we conducted a series of experiments on six models. The results of these experiments revealed that, 1) apart from prior bias caused by question types, there is a notable influence of postfix-related bias in inducing biases, and 2) training VQA models with word-sequence-related variant questions demonstrated improved performance on the out-of-distribution benchmark, and the LXMERT even achieved a 10-point gain without adopting any debiasing methods.

Ultimately, the primary objective of this custom dataset is to enhance the diversity of litter instances and improve their detection accuracy in deep submerged environments by leveraging state-of-the-art deep learning architectures.",

        "abstract": "Retail sales forecasting presents a significant challenge for large retailers such as Walmart and Amazon, due to the vast assortment of products, geographical location heterogeneity, seasonality, and external factors including weather, local economic conditions, and geopolitical events. Various methods have been employed to tackle this challenge, including traditional time series models, machine learning models, and neural network mechanisms, but the difficulty persists. Categorizing data into relevant groups has been shown to improve sales forecast accuracy as time series from different categories may exhibit distinct patterns. In this paper, we propose a new measure to indicate the unique impacts of the trend and seasonality components on a time series and suggest grouping time series based on this measure. We apply this approach to Walmart sales data from 01/29/2011 to 05/22/2016 and generate sales forecasts from 05/23/2016 to 06/19/2016. Our experiments show that the proposed strategy can achieve improved accuracy. Furthermore, we present a robust pipeline for conducting retail sales forecasting.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a control framework that combines model-based optimal control and reinforcement learning (RL) to achieve versatile and robust legged locomotion. Our approach enhances the RL training process by incorporating on-demand reference motions generated through finite-horizon optimal control, covering a broad range of velocities and gaits. These reference motions serve as targets for the RL policy to imitate, leading to the development of robust control policies that can be learned with reliability. Furthermore, by utilizing realistic simulation data that captures whole-body dynamics, RL effectively overcomes the inherent limitations in reference motions imposed by modeling simplifications. We validate the robustness and controllability of the RL training process within our framework through a series of experiments. In these experiments, our method showcases its capability to generalize reference motions and effectively handle more complex locomotion tasks that may pose challenges for the simplified model, thanks to RL's flexibility. Additionally, our framework effortlessly supports the training of control policies for robots with diverse dimensions, eliminating the necessity for robot-specific adjustments in the reward function and hyperparameters.",

        "abstract": "Semi-supervised anomaly detection (SSAD) methods have demonstrated their effectiveness in enhancing unsupervised anomaly detection (UAD) by leveraging few-shot but instructive abnormal instances. However, the dominance of homogeneous normal data over anomalies biases the SSAD models against effectively perceiving anomalies. To address this issue and achieve balanced supervision between heavily imbalanced normal and abnormal data, we develop a novel framework called AnoOnly (Anomaly Only). Unlike existing SSAD methods that resort to strict loss supervision, AnoOnly suspends it and introduces a form of weak supervision for normal data. This weak supervision is instantiated through the utilization of batch normalization, which implicitly performs cluster learning on normal data. When integrated into existing SSAD methods, the proposed AnoOnly demonstrates remarkable performance enhancements across various models and datasets, achieving new state-of-the-art performance. Additionally, our AnoOnly is natively robust to label noise when suffering from data contamination. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/cool-xuan/AnoOnly.",

Decision trees containing leaves with unbalanced accuracy can provide misleading explanations. Low-accuracy leaves give less valid explanations, which could be interpreted as unfairness among explanations. Here, we train a shallow tree with the objective of minimizing the maximum misclassification error across each leaf node. Then, we extend each leaf with a separate tree-based model.

In this paper, we introduce a novel NLP benchmark that poses challenges to current LLMs across four key dimensions: processing long documents (up to 50K tokens), utilizing domain specific knowledge (embodied in legal texts), multilingual understanding (covering five languages), and multitasking (comprising legal document to document Information Retrieval, Court View Generation, Leading Decision Summarization, Citation Extraction, and eight challenging Text Classification tasks). Our benchmark comprises diverse legal NLP datasets from the Swiss legal system, allowing for a comprehensive study of the underlying Non-English, inherently multilingual, federal legal system. Despite recent advances, efficiently processing long documents for intense review/analysis tasks remains an open challenge for language models. Also, comprehensive, domain-specific benchmarks requiring high expertise to develop are rare, as are multilingual benchmarks. This scarcity underscores our contribution's value, considering most public models are trained predominantly on English corpora, while other languages remain understudied, particularly for practical domain-specific NLP tasks. Our benchmark allows for testing and advancing the state-of-the-art LLMs. As part of our study, we evaluate several pre-trained multilingual language models on our benchmark to establish strong baselines as a point of reference.

        "abstract": "Semantic-aware communication is a novel paradigm that draws inspiration from human communication focusing on the delivery of the meaning of messages. It has attracted significant interest recently due to its potential to improve the efficiency and reliability of communication and enhance users' QoE. Most existing works focus on transmitting and delivering the explicit semantic meaning that can be directly identified from the source signal. This paper investigates the implicit semantic-aware communication in which the hidden information that cannot be directly observed from the source signal must be recognized and interpreted by the intended users. To this end, a novel implicit semantic-aware communication (iSAC) architecture is proposed for representing, communicating, and interpreting the implicit semantic meaning between source and destination users. A projection-based semantic encoder is proposed to convert the high-dimensional graphical representation of explicit semantics into a low-dimensional semantic constellation space for efficient physical channel transmission. To enable the destination user to learn and imitate the implicit semantic reasoning process of source user, a generative adversarial imitation learning-based solution, called G-RML, is proposed. Different from existing communication solutions, the source user in G-RML does not focus only on sending as much of the useful messages as possible; but, instead, it tries to guide the destination user to learn a reasoning mechanism to map any observed explicit semantics to the corresponding implicit semantics that are most relevant to the semantic meaning. Compared to the existing solutions, our proposed G-RML requires much less communication and computational resources and scales well to the scenarios involving the communication of rich semantic meanings consisting of a large number of concepts and relations.",

Second, it is difficult to ensure interactive safety due to uncertainty in human behaviors. This paper presents an integrated framework for proactive HRC. A robust intention prediction module, which leverages prior task information and human-in-the-loop training, is learned to guide the robot for efficient collaboration. The proposed framework also uses robust safe control to ensure interactive safety under uncertainty. The developed framework is applied to a co-assembly task using a Kinova Gen3 robot. The experiment demonstrates that our solution is robust to environmental changes as well as different human preferences and behaviors. In addition, it improves task efficiency by approximately 15-20%. Moreover, the experiment demonstrates that our solution can guarantee interactive safety during proactive collaboration.",

In this regard, we propose a pre-trained soft object manipulation skill learning model, namely SoftGPT, that is trained using large amounts of exploration data, consisting of a three-dimensional heterogeneous graph representation and a GPT-based dynamics model. For each downstream task, a goal-oriented policy agent is trained to predict the subsequent actions, and SoftGPT generates the consequences of these actions. Integrating these two approaches establishes a thinking process in the robot's mind that provides rollout for facilitating policy learning. Our results demonstrate that leveraging prior knowledge through this thinking process can efficiently learn various soft object manipulation skills, with the potential for direct learning from human demonstrations.",

        "abstract": "Machine-learning models are known to be vulnerable to evasion attacks that perturb model inputs to induce misclassifications. In this work, we identify real-world scenarios where the true threat cannot be assessed accurately by existing attacks. Specifically, we find that conventional metrics measuring targeted and untargeted robustness do not appropriately reflect a model's ability to withstand attacks from one set of source classes to another set of target classes. To address the shortcomings of existing methods, we formally define a new metric, termed group-based robustness, that complements existing metrics and is better-suited for evaluating model performance in certain attack scenarios. We show empirically that group-based robustness allows us to distinguish between models' vulnerability against specific threat models in situations where traditional robustness metrics do not apply. Moreover, to measure group-based robustness efficiently and accurately, we 1) propose two loss functions and 2) identify three new attack strategies. We show empirically that with comparable success rates, finding evasive samples using our new loss functions saves computation by a factor as large as the number of targeted classes, and finding evasive samples using our new attack strategies saves time by up to 99\\% compared to brute-force search methods. Finally, we propose a defense method that increases group-based robustness by up to 3.52$\\times$.",

Experiments across a variety of simulated and real robot setups that involve tasks with different modes of ambiguity (e.g., from spatial to numeric uncertainties, from human preferences to Winograd schemas) show that KnowNo performs favorably over modern baselines (which may involve ensembles or extensive prompt tuning) in terms of improving efficiency and autonomy, while providing formal assurances.

The dataset is generated by GPT-3.5-turbo and comprises programs with varying levels of complexity. Some programs handle complicated tasks like network management, table games, or encryption, while others deal with simpler tasks like string manipulation. Every program is labeled with the vulnerabilities found within the source code, indicating the type, line number, and vulnerable function name. This is accomplished by employing a formal verification method using the Efficient SMT-based Bounded Model Checker (ESBMC), which uses model checking, abstract interpretation, constraint programming, and satisfiability modulo theories to reason over safety/security properties in programs. This approach definitively detects vulnerabilities and offers a formal model known as a counterexample, thus eliminating the possibility of generating false positive reports. We have associated the identified vulnerabilities with Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) numbers. We make the source code available for the 112, 000 programs, accompanied by a separate file containing the vulnerabilities detected in each program, making the dataset ideal for training LLMs and machine learning algorithms.

        "abstract": "Advanced AI models hold the promise of tremendous benefits for humanity, but society needs to proactively manage the accompanying risks. In this paper, we focus on what we term \"frontier AI\" models: highly capable foundation models that could possess dangerous capabilities sufficient to pose severe risks to public safety. Frontier AI models pose a distinct regulatory challenge: dangerous capabilities can arise unexpectedly; it is difficult to robustly prevent a deployed model from being misused; and, it is difficult to stop a model's capabilities from proliferating broadly. To address these challenges, at least three building blocks for the regulation of frontier models are needed: (1) standard-setting processes to identify appropriate requirements for frontier AI developers, (2) registration and reporting requirements to provide regulators with visibility into frontier AI development processes, and (3) mechanisms to ensure compliance with safety standards for the development and deployment of frontier AI models. Industry self-regulation is an important first step. However, wider societal discussions and government intervention will be needed to create standards and to ensure compliance with them. We consider several options to this end, including granting enforcement powers to supervisory authorities and licensure regimes for frontier AI models. Finally, we propose an initial set of safety standards. These include conducting pre-deployment risk assessments; external scrutiny of model behavior; using risk assessments to inform deployment decisions; and monitoring and responding to new information about model capabilities and uses post-deployment. We hope this discussion contributes to the broader conversation on how to balance public safety risks and innovation benefits from advances at the frontier of AI development.",

In contrast to behavior cloning, which assumes the data is collected from expert demonstrations, offline RL can work with non-expert data and multimodal behavior policies. However, offline RL algorithms face challenges in handling distribution shifts and effectively representing policies due to the lack of online interaction during training. Prior work on offline RL uses conditional diffusion models to represent multimodal behavior in the dataset. Nevertheless, these methods are not tailored toward alleviating the out-of-distribution state generalization. We introduce a novel method named State Reconstruction for Diffusion Policies (SRDP), incorporating state reconstruction feature learning in the recent class of diffusion policies to address the out-of-distribution generalization problem. State reconstruction loss promotes generalizable representation learning of states to alleviate the distribution shift incurred by the out-of-distribution (OOD) states. We design a novel 2D Multimodal Contextual Bandit environment to illustrate the OOD generalization and faster convergence of SRDP compared to prior algorithms.

Existing work prompts the LLMs with a list of demonstration examples (i.e. question-SQL pairs) to generate SQL, but the fixed prompts can hardly handle the scenario where the semantic gap between the retrieved demonstration and the input question is large.

However, they differ significantly in the way the selected segments are aggregated, resulting in distinct dynamics and final results. We observe a unique signature of models learned using these paradigms and explain this as a consequence of the evolution of the classification model under gradient descent when the focus model is fixed. We also analyze these paradigms in a simple setting and derive closed-form expressions for the parameter trajectory under gradient flow. With the soft attention loss, the focus model improves quickly at initialization and splutters later on. On the other hand, hard attention loss behaves in the opposite fashion. Based on our observations, we propose a simple hybrid approach that combines the advantages of the different loss functions and demonstrates it on a collection of semi-synthetic and real-world datasets",

This bound is tight (Dalal et al., 2020), and slower than $O(1/\\sqrt{t})$. GTD algorithms also have two step-size parameters, which are difficult to tune. In literature, there is a \"single-time-scale\" formulation of GTD. However, this formulation still has two step-size parameters.  This paper presents a truly single-time-scale GTD algorithm for minimizing the Norm of Expected td Update (NEU) objective, and it has only one step-size parameter. We prove that the new algorithm, called Impression GTD, converges at least as fast as $O(1/t)$. Furthermore, based on a generalization of the expected smoothness (Gower et al. 2019), called $L$-$\\lambda$ smoothness, we are able to prove that the new GTD converges even faster, in fact, with a linear rate. Our rate actually also improves Gower et al.'s result with a tighter bound under a weaker assumption. Besides Impression GTD, we also prove the rates of three other GTD algorithms, one by Yao and Liu (2008), another called A-transpose-TD (Sutton et al., 2008), and a counterpart of A-transpose-TD. The convergence rates of all the four GTD algorithms are proved in a single generic GTD framework to which $L$-$\\lambda$ smoothness applies. Empirical results on Random walks, Boyan chain, and Baird counterexample show that Impression GTD converges much faster than existing GTD algorithms for both on-policy and off-policy learning problems, with well-performing step-sizes in a big range.",

        "abstract": "The rise in popularity of text-to-image generative artificial intelligence (AI) has attracted widespread public interest. We demonstrate that this technology can be attacked to generate content that subtly manipulates its users. We propose a Backdoor Attack on text-to-image Generative Models (BAGM), which upon triggering, infuses the generated images with manipulative details that are naturally blended in the content. Our attack is the first to target three popular text-to-image generative models across three stages of the generative process by modifying the behaviour of the embedded tokenizer, the language model or the image generative model. Based on the penetration level, BAGM takes the form of a suite of attacks that are referred to as surface, shallow and deep attacks in this article. Given the existing gap within this domain, we also contribute a comprehensive set of quantitative metrics designed specifically for assessing the effectiveness of backdoor attacks on text-to-image models. The efficacy of BAGM is established by attacking state-of-the-art generative models, using a marketing scenario as the target domain. To that end, we contribute a dataset of branded product images. Our embedded backdoors increase the bias towards the target outputs by more than five times the usual, without compromising the model robustness or the generated content utility. By exposing generative AI's vulnerabilities, we encourage researchers to tackle these challenges and practitioners to exercise caution when using pre-trained models.

These innovations translate human labor efforts into automated intelligent systems employed in various areas such as autonomous driving, robotics, Internet-of-Things (IoT), and numerous other impactful applications. NVIDIA's Jetson platform is one of the pioneers in offering optimal performance regarding energy efficiency and throughput in the execution of deep learning algorithms. Previously, most benchmarking analysis was based on 2D images with a single deep learning model for each comparison result. In this paper, we implement an end-to-end video-based crime-scene anomaly detection system inputting from surveillance videos and the system is deployed and completely operates on multiple Jetson edge devices (Nano, AGX Xavier, Orin Nano). The comparison analysis includes the integration of Torch-TensorRT as a software developer kit from NVIDIA for the model performance optimisation. The system is built based on the PySlowfast open-source project from Facebook as the coding template. The end-to-end system process comprises the videos from camera, data preprocessing pipeline, feature extractor and the anomaly detection. We provide the experience of an AI-based system deployment on various Jetson Edge devices with Docker technology. Regarding anomaly detectors, a weakly supervised video-based deep learning model called Robust Temporal Feature Magnitude Learning (RTFM) is applied in the system. The approach system reaches 47.56 frames per second (FPS) inference speed on a Jetson edge device with only 3.11 GB RAM usage total. We also discover the promising Jetson device that the AI system achieves 15% better performance than the previous version of Jetson devices while consuming 50% less energy power.",

We enhance ChatGPT's ability to reason for the system's perspective by integrating in-context learning with commonsense knowledge.

        "abstract": "Time series analysis is a fundamental task in various application domains, and deep learning approaches have demonstrated remarkable performance in this area. However, many real-world time series data exhibit significant periodic or quasi-periodic dynamics that are often not adequately captured by existing deep learning-based solutions. This results in an incomplete representation of the underlying dynamic behaviors of interest. To address this gap, we propose an unsupervised method called Floss that automatically regularizes learned representations in the frequency domain. The Floss method first automatically detects major periodicities from the time series. It then employs periodic shift and spectral density similarity measures to learn meaningful representations with periodic consistency. In addition, Floss can be easily incorporated into both supervised, semi-supervised, and unsupervised learning frameworks. We conduct extensive experiments on common time series classification, forecasting, and anomaly detection tasks to demonstrate the effectiveness of Floss. We incorporate Floss into several representative deep learning solutions to justify our design choices and demonstrate that it is capable of automatically discovering periodic dynamics and improving state-of-the-art deep learning models.",

        "abstract": "Echo State Networks (ESNs) are time-series processing models working under the Echo State Property (ESP) principle. The ESP is a notion of stability that imposes an asymptotic fading of the memory of the input. On the other hand, the resulting inherent architectural bias of ESNs may lead to an excessive loss of information, which in turn harms the performance in certain tasks with long short-term memory requirements. With the goal of bringing together the fading memory property and the ability to retain as much memory as possible, in this paper we introduce a new ESN architecture, called the Edge of Stability Echo State Network (ES$^2$N). The introduced ES$^2$N model is based on defining the reservoir layer as a convex combination of a nonlinear reservoir (as in the standard ESN), and a linear reservoir that implements an orthogonal transformation. We provide a thorough mathematical analysis of the introduced model, proving that the whole eigenspectrum of the Jacobian of the ES$^2$N map can be contained in an annular neighbourhood of a complex circle of controllable radius, and exploit this property to demonstrate that the ES$^2$N's forward dynamics evolves close to the edge-of-chaos regime by design. Remarkably, our experimental analysis shows that the newly introduced reservoir model is able to reach the theoretical maximum short-term memory capacity. At the same time, in comparison to standard ESN, ES$^2$N is shown to offer an excellent trade-off between memory and nonlinearity, as well as a significant improvement of performance in autoregressive nonlinear modeling.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we investigate transfer learning in partially observable contextual bandits, where agents have limited knowledge from other agents and partial information about hidden confounders. We first convert the problem to identifying or partially identifying causal effects between actions and rewards through optimization problems. To solve these optimization problems, we discretize the original functional constraints of unknown distributions into linear constraints, and sample compatible causal models via sequentially solving linear programmings to obtain causal bounds with the consideration of estimation error. Our sampling algorithms provide desirable convergence results for suitable sampling distributions. We then show how causal bounds can be applied to improving classical bandit algorithms and affect the regrets with respect to the size of action sets and function spaces. Notably, in the task with function approximation which allows us to handle general context distributions, our method improves the order dependence on function space size compared with previous literatures. We formally prove that our causally enhanced algorithms outperform classical bandit algorithms and achieve orders of magnitude faster convergence rates. Finally, we perform simulations that demonstrate the efficiency of our strategy compared to the current state-of-the-art methods. This research has the potential to enhance the performance of contextual bandit agents in real-world applications where data is scarce and costly to obtain.",

        "abstract": "Salient Object Detection (SOD) aims to identify and segment the most conspicuous objects in an image or video. As an important pre-processing step, it has many potential applications in multimedia and vision tasks. With the advance of imaging devices, SOD with high-resolution images is of great demand, recently. However, traditional SOD methods are largely limited to low-resolution images, making them difficult to adapt to the development of High-Resolution SOD (HRSOD). Although some HRSOD methods emerge, there are no large enough datasets for training and evaluating. Besides, current HRSOD methods generally produce incomplete object regions and irregular object boundaries. To address above issues, in this work, we first propose a new HRS10K dataset, which contains 10,500 high-quality annotated images at 2K-8K resolution. As far as we know, it is the largest dataset for the HRSOD task, which will significantly help future works in training and evaluating models. Furthermore, to improve the HRSOD performance, we propose a novel Recurrent Multi-scale Transformer (RMFormer), which recurrently utilizes shared Transformers and multi-scale refinement architectures. Thus, high-resolution saliency maps can be generated with the guidance of lower-resolution predictions. Extensive experiments on both high-resolution and low-resolution benchmarks show the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed framework.

        "abstract": "The growing use of voice user interfaces has led to a surge in the collection and storage of speech data. While data collection allows for the development of efficient tools powering most speech services, it also poses serious privacy issues for users as centralized storage makes private personal speech data vulnerable to cyber threats. With the increasing use of voice-based digital assistants like Amazon's Alexa, Google's Home, and Apple's Siri, and with the increasing ease with which personal speech data can be collected, the risk of malicious use of voice-cloning and speaker/gender/pathological/etc. recognition has increased.  This thesis proposes solutions for anonymizing speech and evaluating the degree of the anonymization. In this work, anonymization refers to making personal speech data unlinkable to an identity while maintaining the usefulness (utility) of the speech signal (e.g., access to linguistic content). We start by identifying several challenges that evaluation protocols need to consider to evaluate the degree of privacy protection properly. We clarify how anonymization systems must be configured for evaluation purposes and highlight that many practical deployment configurations do not permit privacy evaluation. Furthermore, we study and examine the most common voice conversion-based anonymization system and identify its weak points before suggesting new methods to overcome some limitations. We isolate all components of the anonymization system to evaluate the degree of speaker PPI associated with each of them. Then, we propose several transformation methods for each component to reduce as much as possible speaker PPI while maintaining utility. We promote anonymization algorithms based on quantization-based transformation as an alternative to the most-used and well-known noise-based approach. Finally, we endeavor a new attack method to invert anonymization.",

        "abstract": "The advanced language processing abilities of large language models (LLMs) have stimulated debate over their capacity to replicate human-like cognitive processes. One differentiating factor between language processing in LLMs and humans is that language input is often grounded in several perceptual modalities, whereas most LLMs process solely text-based information. Multimodal grounding allows humans to integrate - e.g. visual context with linguistic information and thereby place constraints on the space of upcoming words, reducing cognitive load and improving comprehension. Recent multimodal LLMs (mLLMs) combine a visual-linguistic embedding space with a transformer type attention mechanism for next-word prediction. Here we ask whether predictive language processing based on multimodal input in mLLMs aligns with humans. Two-hundred participants watched short audio-visual clips and estimated predictability of an upcoming verb or noun. The same clips were processed by the mLLM CLIP, with predictability scores based on comparing image and text feature vectors. Eye-tracking was used to estimate what visual features participants attended to, and CLIP's visual attention weights were recorded. We find that alignment of predictability scores was driven by multimodality of CLIP (no alignment for a unimodal state-of-the-art LLM) and by the attention mechanism (no alignment when attention weights were perturbated or when the same input was fed to a multimodal model without attention). We further find a significant spatial overlap between CLIP's visual attention weights and human eye-tracking data. Results suggest that comparable processes of integrating multimodal information, guided by attention to relevant visual features, supports predictive language processing in mLLMs and humans.",

Numerous historical datasets used for short and medium-range weather forecasts are typically organized into a regular spatial grid structure. This arrangement closely resembles images: each weather variable can be visualized as a map or, when considering the temporal axis, as a video. Several classes of generative models, comprising Generative Adversarial Networks, Variational Autoencoders, or the recent Denoising Diffusion Models have largely proved their applicability to the next-frame prediction problem, and is thus natural to test their performance on the weather prediction benchmarks. Diffusion models are particularly appealing in this context, due to the intrinsically probabilistic nature of weather forecasting: what we are really interested to model is the probability distribution of weather indicators, whose expected value is the most likely prediction.  In our study, we focus on a specific subset of the ERA-5 dataset, which includes hourly data pertaining to Central Europe from the years 2016 to 2021. Within this context, we examine the efficacy of diffusion models in handling the task of precipitation nowcasting. Our work is conducted in comparison to the performance of well-established U-Net models, as documented in the existing literature. Our proposed approach of Generative Ensemble Diffusion (GED) utilizes a diffusion model to generate a set of possible weather scenarios which are then amalgamated into a probable prediction via the use of a post-processing network. This approach, in comparison to recent deep learning models, substantially outperformed them in terms of overall performance.",

However, their convergence on this example is still very slow, and the nature of the slowness is not well understood, e.g., see (Sutton and Barto 2018).  This note is to understand in particular, why TDC is slow on this example, and provide a debugging analysis to understand this behavior. Our debugging technique can be used to study the convergence behavior of two-time-scale stochastic approximation algorithms. We also provide empirical results of the recent Impression GTD algorithm on this example, showing the convergence is very fast, in fact, in a linear rate.

To fill in this gap, we propose an event-based dynamic graph learning framework for patent application trend prediction. In particular, our method is founded on the memorable representations of both companies and patent classification codes. When a new patent is observed, the representations of the related companies and classification codes are updated according to the historical memories and the currently encoded messages. Moreover, a hierarchical message passing mechanism is provided to capture the semantic proximities of patent classification codes by updating their representations along the hierarchical taxonomy. Finally, the patent application trend is predicted by aggregating the representations of the target company and classification codes from static, dynamic, and hierarchical perspectives. Experiments on real-world data demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach under various experimental conditions, and also reveal the abilities of our method in learning semantics of classification codes and tracking technology developing trajectories of companies.",

        "abstract": "The Potential Outcome Framework (POF) plays a prominent role in the field of causal inference. Most causal inference models based on the POF (CIMs-POF) are designed for eliminating confounding bias and default to an underlying assumption of Confounding Covariates. This assumption posits that the covariates consist solely of confounders. However, the assumption of Confounding Covariates is challenging to maintain in practice, particularly when dealing with high-dimensional covariates. While certain methods have been proposed to differentiate the distinct components of covariates prior to conducting causal inference, the consequences of treating non-confounding covariates as confounders remain unclear. This ambiguity poses a potential risk when conducting causal inference in practical scenarios. In this paper, we present a unified graphical framework for the CIMs-POF, which greatly enhances the comprehension of these models' underlying principles. Using this graphical framework, we quantitatively analyze the extent to which the inference performance of CIMs-POF is influenced when incorporating various types of non-confounding covariates, such as instrumental variables, mediators, colliders, and adjustment variables. The key findings are: in the task of eliminating confounding bias, the optimal scenario is for the covariates to exclusively encompass confounders; in the subsequent task of inferring counterfactual outcomes, the adjustment variables contribute to more accurate inferences. Furthermore, extensive experiments conducted on synthetic datasets consistently validate these theoretical conclusions.",

Specifically, we propose to employ multiple intelligent agents (i.e., reasoners and an evaluator) to work collaboratively in a reasoning-and-consensus paradigm for elevated reasoning faithfulness. The reasoners focus on providing solutions with human-like causality to solve open-domain problems. On the other hand, the \\textit{evaluator} agent scrutinizes if a solution is deducible from a non-causal perspective and if it still holds when challenged by a counterfactual candidate. According to the extensive and comprehensive evaluations on a variety of knowledge reasoning tasks (e.g., science question answering and commonsense reasoning), our framework outperforms all compared state-of-the-art approaches by large margins.",

        "abstract": "We address a challenging lifelong few-shot image generation task for the first time. In this situation, a generative model learns a sequence of tasks using only a few samples per task. Consequently, the learned model encounters both catastrophic forgetting and overfitting problems at a time. Existing studies on lifelong GANs have proposed modulation-based methods to prevent catastrophic forgetting. However, they require considerable additional parameters and cannot generate high-fidelity and diverse images from limited data. On the other hand, the existing few-shot GANs suffer from severe catastrophic forgetting when learning multiple tasks. To alleviate these issues, we propose a framework called Lifelong Few-Shot GAN (LFS-GAN) that can generate high-quality and diverse images in lifelong few-shot image generation task. Our proposed framework learns each task using an efficient task-specific modulator - Learnable Factorized Tensor (LeFT). LeFT is rank-constrained and has a rich representation ability due to its unique reconstruction technique. Furthermore, we propose a novel mode seeking loss to improve the diversity of our model in low-data circumstances. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed LFS-GAN can generate high-fidelity and diverse images without any forgetting and mode collapse in various domains, achieving state-of-the-art in lifelong few-shot image generation task. Surprisingly, we find that our LFS-GAN even outperforms the existing few-shot GANs in the few-shot image generation task. The code is available at Github.",

        "abstract": "Big models, exemplified by Large Language Models (LLMs), are models typically pre-trained on massive data and comprised of enormous parameters, which not only obtain significantly improved performance across diverse tasks but also present emergent capabilities absent in smaller models. However, the growing intertwining of big models with everyday human lives poses potential risks and might cause serious social harm. Therefore, many efforts have been made to align LLMs with humans to make them better follow user instructions and satisfy human preferences. Nevertheless, `what to align with' has not been fully discussed, and inappropriate alignment goals might even backfire. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive survey of different alignment goals in existing work and trace their evolution paths to help identify the most essential goal. Particularly, we investigate related works from two perspectives: the definition of alignment goals and alignment evaluation. Our analysis encompasses three distinct levels of alignment goals and reveals a goal transformation from fundamental abilities to value orientation, indicating the potential of intrinsic human values as the alignment goal for enhanced LLMs. Based on such results, we further discuss the challenges of achieving such intrinsic value alignment and provide a collection of available resources for future research on the alignment of big models.",

        "abstract": "We present a method for teaching machines to understand and model the underlying spatial common sense of diverse human-object interactions in 3D in a self-supervised way. This is a challenging task, as there exist specific manifolds of the interactions that can be considered human-like and natural, but the human pose and the geometry of objects can vary even for similar interactions. Such diversity makes the annotating task of 3D interactions difficult and hard to scale, which limits the potential to reason about that in a supervised way. One way of learning the 3D spatial relationship between humans and objects during interaction is by showing multiple 2D images captured from different viewpoints when humans interact with the same type of objects. The core idea of our method is to leverage a generative model that produces high-quality 2D images from an arbitrary text prompt input as an \"unbounded\" data generator with effective controllability and view diversity. Despite its imperfection of the image quality over real images, we demonstrate that the synthesized images are sufficient to learn the 3D human-object spatial relations. We present multiple strategies to leverage the synthesized images, including (1) the first method to leverage a generative image model for 3D human-object spatial relation learning; (2) a framework to reason about the 3D spatial relations from inconsistent 2D cues in a self-supervised manner via 3D occupancy reasoning with pose canonicalization; (3) semantic clustering to disambiguate different types of interactions with the same object types; and (4) a novel metric to assess the quality of 3D spatial learning of interaction.",

        "abstract": "Recently, digital humans for interpersonal interaction in virtual environments have gained significant attention. In this paper, we introduce a novel multi-dancer synthesis task called partner dancer generation, which involves synthesizing virtual human dancers capable of performing dance with users. The task aims to control the pose diversity between the lead dancer and the partner dancer. The core of this task is to ensure the controllable diversity of the generated partner dancer while maintaining temporal coordination with the lead dancer. This scenario varies from earlier research in generating dance motions driven by music, as our emphasis is on automatically designing partner dancer postures according to pre-defined diversity, the pose of lead dancer, as well as the accompanying tunes. To achieve this objective, we propose a three-stage framework called Dance-with-You (DanY). Initially, we employ a 3D Pose Collection stage to collect a wide range of basic dance poses as references for motion generation. Then, we introduce a hyper-parameter that coordinates the similarity between dancers by masking poses to prevent the generation of sequences that are over-diverse or consistent. To avoid the rigidity of movements, we design a Dance Pre-generated stage to pre-generate these masked poses instead of filling them with zeros. After that, a Dance Motion Transfer stage is adopted with leader sequences and music, in which a multi-conditional sampling formula is rewritten to transfer the pre-generated poses into a sequence with a partner style. In practice, to address the lack of multi-person datasets, we introduce AIST-M, a new dataset for partner dancer generation, which is publicly availiable. Comprehensive evaluations on our AIST-M dataset demonstrate that the proposed DanY can synthesize satisfactory partner dancer results with controllable diversity.",

Compared to SCNs and random vector functional-link (RVFL) nets with binarized implementation, the model storage of SCMs can be significantly compressed while retaining favourable prediction performance. Besides the architecture of the SCM learner model and its learning algorithm, as an important part of this contribution, we also provide a theoretical basis on the learning capacity of SCMs by analysing the model's complexity. Experimental studies are carried out over some benchmark datasets and three industrial applications. The results demonstrate that SCM has great potential for dealing with industrial data analytics.",

For the multiple-label scenario, the downstream application is image classification on two benchmark datasets.

This issue is mainly introduced by the system dynamic difference between the training simulator and the real-world environments. The Large Language Models (LLMs) are trained on mass knowledge and proved to be equipped with astonishing inference abilities. In this work, we leverage LLMs to understand and profile the system dynamics by a prompt-based grounded action transformation. Accepting the cloze prompt template, and then filling in the answer based on accessible context, the pre-trained LLM's inference ability is exploited and applied to understand how weather conditions, traffic states, and road types influence traffic dynamics, being aware of this, the policies' action is taken and grounded based on realistic dynamics, thus help the agent learn a more realistic policy.

The core idea is to consider the so-called observation tree as a first-class citizen in the learning process. Though this idea is explored in recent work, we take it to its full effect by enabling its use with any existing learner and minimizing the number of tests performed on the system under learning, specially in the face of conflicts. We evaluate C3AL in a large set of benchmarks, covering over 30 different realistic targets, and over 18,000 different scenarios.

The foundational architecture of most GNNs involves the dissemination of information through message aggregation and transformation among interconnected nodes, a mechanism that has demonstrated remarkable efficacy across diverse applications encompassing node classification, link prediction, and recommendation systems. Nonetheless, their potential prowess encounters a restraint intrinsic to scenarios necessitating extensive contextual insights. In certain contexts, accurate predictions hinge not only upon a node's immediate local surroundings but also on interactions spanning far-reaching domains. This intricate demand for long-range information dissemination exposes a pivotal challenge recognized as \"over-squashing,\" wherein the fidelity of information flow from distant nodes becomes distorted. This phenomenon significantly curtails the efficiency of message-passing mechanisms, particularly for tasks reliant on intricate long-distance interactions.

        "abstract": "In recent years, there have been remarkable advancements in the performance of Transformer-based Large Language Models (LLMs) across various domains. As these LLMs are deployed for increasingly complex tasks, they often face the need to conduct longer reasoning processes or understand larger contexts. In these situations, the length generalization failure of LLMs on long sequences becomes more prominent. Most pre-training schemes truncate training sequences to a fixed length. LLMs often struggle to generate fluent and coherent texts, let alone carry out downstream tasks, after longer contexts, even with relative positional encoding designed to cope with this problem. Common solutions such as finetuning on longer corpora often involve daunting hardware and time costs and require careful training process design. To more efficiently leverage the generation capacity of existing LLMs, we theoretically and empirically investigate the main out-of-distribution (OOD) factors contributing to this problem. Inspired by this diagnosis, we propose a simple yet effective solution for on-the-fly length generalization, LM-Infinite. It involves only a $\\Lambda$-shaped attention mask (to avoid excessive attended tokens) and a distance limit (to avoid unseen distances) while requiring no parameter updates or learning. We find it applicable to a variety of LLMs using relative-position encoding methods. LM-Infinite is computationally efficient with $O(n)$ time and space, and demonstrates consistent text generation fluency and quality to as long as 32k tokens on ArXiv and OpenWebText2 datasets, with 2.72x decoding speedup.

Firstly, while much of prior work focuses on studying a fixed pool of agents that remains static regardless of their evaluations, we consider the impact of selection procedure by which agents are not only evaluated, but also selected. When each decision maker unilaterally selects agents by maximising their own utility, we show that the optimal selection rule is a trade-off between selecting the best agents and providing incentives to maximise the agents' improvement. Furthermore, this optimal selection rule relies on incorrect predictions of agents' outcomes. Hence, we study the conditions under which a decision maker's optimal selection rule will not lead to deterioration of agents' outcome nor cause unjust reduction in agents' selection chance. To that end, we provide an analytical form of the optimal selection rule and a mechanism to retrieve the causal parameters from observational data, under certain assumptions on agents' behaviour. Secondly, when there are multiple decision makers, the interference between selection rules introduces another source of biases in estimating the underlying causal parameters. To address this problem, we provide a cooperative protocol which all decision makers must collectively adopt to recover the true causal parameters. Lastly, we complement our theoretical results with simulation studies. Our results highlight not only the importance of causal modeling as a strategy to mitigate the effect of gaming, as suggested by previous work, but also the need of a benevolent regulator to enable it.",

The proposed approach leverages meta-learning to explicitly learn network parameters for test-time adaption. Our method does not require any prior information about the test data. During meta-training, the model parameters are learned from a collection of instance-level tasks, each of which consists of a sparse-dense pair of point clouds from the training data.

        "abstract": "Graph classification, aiming at learning the graph-level representations for effective class assignments, has received outstanding achievements, which heavily relies on high-quality datasets that have balanced class distribution. In fact, most real-world graph data naturally presents a long-tailed form, where the head classes occupy much more samples than the tail classes, it thus is essential to study the graph-level classification over long-tailed data while still remaining largely unexplored. However, most existing long-tailed learning methods in visions fail to jointly optimize the representation learning and classifier training, as well as neglect the mining of the hard-to-classify classes. Directly applying existing methods to graphs may lead to sub-optimal performance, since the model trained on graphs would be more sensitive to the long-tailed distribution due to the complex topological characteristics. Hence, in this paper, we propose a novel long-tailed graph-level classification framework via Collaborative Multi-expert Learning (CoMe) to tackle the problem. To equilibrate the contributions of head and tail classes, we first develop balanced contrastive learning from the view of representation learning, and then design an individual-expert classifier training based on hard class mining. In addition, we execute gated fusion and disentangled knowledge distillation among the multiple experts to promote the collaboration in a multi-expert framework. Comprehensive experiments are performed on seven widely-used benchmark datasets to demonstrate the superiority of our method CoMe over state-of-the-art baselines.",

        "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.16684",
        "abstract": "The vulnerabilities to backdoor attacks have recently threatened the trustworthiness of machine learning models in practical applications. Conventional wisdom suggests that not everyone can be an attacker since the process of designing the trigger generation algorithm often involves significant effort and extensive experimentation to ensure the attack's stealthiness and effectiveness. Alternatively, this paper shows that there exists a more severe backdoor threat: anyone can exploit an easily-accessible algorithm for silent backdoor attacks. Specifically, this attacker can employ the widely-used lossy image compression from a plethora of compression tools to effortlessly inject a trigger pattern into an image without leaving any noticeable trace; i.e., the generated triggers are natural artifacts. One does not require extensive knowledge to click on the \"convert\" or \"save as\" button while using tools for lossy image compression. Via this attack, the adversary does not need to design a trigger generator as seen in prior works and only requires poisoning the data. Empirically, the proposed attack consistently achieves 100% attack success rate in several benchmark datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR-10, GTSRB and CelebA. More significantly, the proposed attack can still achieve almost 100% attack success rate with very small (approximately 10%) poisoning rates in the clean label setting. The generated trigger of the proposed attack using one lossy compression algorithm is also transferable across other related compression algorithms, exacerbating the severity of this backdoor threat. This work takes another crucial step toward understanding the extensive risks of backdoor attacks in practice, urging practitioners to investigate similar attacks and relevant backdoor mitigation methods.",

        "abstract": "The protection of Industrial Control Systems (ICS) that are employed in public critical infrastructures is of utmost importance due to catastrophic physical damages cyberattacks may cause. The research community requires testbeds for validation and comparing various intrusion detection algorithms to protect ICS. However, there exist high barriers to entry for research and education in the ICS cybersecurity domain due to expensive hardware, software, and inherent dangers of manipulating real-world systems. To close the gap, built upon recently developed 3D high-fidelity simulators, we further showcase our integrated framework to automatically launch cyberattacks, collect data, train machine learning models, and evaluate for practical chemical and manufacturing processes. On our testbed, we validate our proposed intrusion detection model called Minimal Threshold and Window SVM (MinTWin SVM) that utilizes unsupervised machine learning via a one-class SVM in combination with a sliding window and classification threshold. Results show that MinTWin SVM minimizes false positives and is responsive to physical process anomalies. Furthermore, we incorporate our framework with ICS cybersecurity education by using our dataset in an undergraduate machine learning course where students gain hands-on experience in practicing machine learning theory with a practical ICS dataset. All of our implementations have been open-sourced.",

        "abstract": "With the growing imbalance between limited medical resources and escalating demands, AI-based clinical tasks have become paramount. Medication recommendation, as a sub-domain, aims to amalgamate longitudinal patient history with medical knowledge, assisting physicians in prescribing safer and more accurate medication combinations. Existing methods overlook the inherent long-tail distribution in medical data, lacking balanced representation between head and tail data, which leads to sub-optimal model performance. To address this challenge, we introduce StratMed, a model that incorporates an innovative relevance stratification mechanism. It harmonizes discrepancies in data long-tail distribution and strikes a balance between the safety and accuracy of medication combinations. Specifically, we first construct a pre-training method using deep learning networks to obtain entity representation. After that, we design a pyramid-like data stratification method to obtain more generalized entity relationships by reinforcing the features of unpopular entities. Based on this relationship, we designed two graph structures to express medication precision and safety at the same level to obtain visit representations. Finally, the patient's historical clinical information is fitted to generate medication combinations for the current health condition. Experiments on the MIMIC-III dataset demonstrate that our method has outperformed current state-of-the-art methods in four evaluation metrics (including safety and accuracy).",

        "abstract": "The rapid advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) have led to a growing trend of human-AI teaming (HAT) in various fields. As machines continue to evolve from mere automation to a state of autonomy, they are increasingly exhibiting unexpected behaviors and human-like cognitive/intelligent capabilities, including situation awareness (SA). This shift has the potential to enhance the performance of mixed human-AI teams over all-human teams, underscoring the need for a better understanding of the dynamic SA interactions between humans and machines. To this end, we provide a review of leading SA theoretical models and a new framework for SA in the HAT context based on the key features and processes of HAT. The Agent Teaming Situation Awareness (ATSA) framework unifies human and AI behavior, and involves bidirectional, and dynamic interaction. The framework is based on the individual and team SA models and elaborates on the cognitive mechanisms for modeling HAT. Similar perceptual cycles are adopted for the individual (including both human and AI) and the whole team, which is tailored to the unique requirements of the HAT context. ATSA emphasizes cohesive and effective HAT through structures and components, including teaming understanding, teaming control, and the world, as well as adhesive transactive part. We further propose several future research directions to expand on the distinctive contributions of ATSA and address the specific and pressing next steps.",

Additionally, it serves as a production platform to test vaccines and other valuable substances. Among its approximately 3.1 Gb genome, 57,583 genes have been annotated within a 61 Mb region. We created a comprehensive and easy-to-use platform to use transcriptomes for modern annotation. These tools allow to visualize gene expression profiles, draw molecular evolutionary phylogenetic trees of gene families, perform functional enrichment analyses, and facilitate output downloads. To demonstrate their utility, we analyzed the gene expression profiles of enzymes within the nicotine biosynthesis pathway, a secondary metabolic pathway characteristic of the Nicotiana genus. Using the developed tool, expression profiles of the nicotine biosynthesis pathway genes were generated. The expression patterns of eight gene groups in the pathway were strongly expressed in the roots and weakly expressed in leaves and flowers of N. benthamiana. The results were consistent with the established gene expression profiles in Nicotiana tabacum and provided insights into gene family composition and expression trends. The compilation of this database tool can facilitate genetic analysis of N. benthamiana in the future.",

        "abstract": "C4 photosynthesis has arisen from the ancestral C3 state in over sixty lineages of angiosperms. It is widely accepted that an early step in C4 evolution is restriction of glycine decarboxylase activity to bundle sheath cells to generate the so-called C2 pathway. In C2 Moricandia species, changes to the cis-regulatory region controlling expression of the P-subunit of GLYCINE DECARBOXYLASE (GLDP) in mesophyll cells enables this trait, but the mechanism underpinning GLDP expression in the bundle sheath is not known. We identify a MYC-MYB transcription factor module previously associated with the control of glucosinolate biosynthesis as the basis of GLDP expression in bundle sheath cells. In C3 Arabidopsis thaliana this module drives GLDP expression in bundle sheath cells along with as yet unidentified factors driving expression in mesophyll cells. In the C2 species Moricandia arvensis, GLDP expression is lost from mesophyll cells and the MYC-MYB dependent expression in the bundle sheath is revealed. Evolution of C2 photosynthesis is thus associated with a MYC-MYB based transcriptional network already present in the C3 state. This work identifies a molecular genetic mechanism underlying the bundle sheath accumulation of glycine decarboxylase required for C2 photosynthesis and thus a foundational step in the evolution of C4 photosynthesis.",

Upon activation, coiled-coil (CC) domain containing NLRs (CNLs) oligomerize to form apparent cation channels that promote calcium influx and cell death induction, with the alpha-1 helix of the individual CC domains penetrating membranes. Some members of a monophyletic subclass of CNLs, the ancient and autonomous NLRs (ANLs), are characterized by putative N-myristoylation and S-acylation sites at the N-terminus of their CCG10/GA domain, potentially mediating permanent membrane association. Whether these Potentially Membrane Localized NLRs (PMLs) mediate cell death upon activation in a similar way as reported for other CNLs has been unknown. We integrated phylogenetic, cell-biological, and functional studies to uncover the cell death function of an atypical but conserved Arabidopsis PML, PML5, which has a 113 amino acid deletion in its CCG10/GA domain. Active PML5 oligomers localize in Golgi membranes and the tonoplast, changes vacuolar morphology, and induce cell death, with the short N-terminus being sufficient for cell death. Mutant analysis supports a potential key role of PMLs in plant immunity. Similar deletions as in Arabidopsis PML5 are found in several Brassicales paralogs, pointing to the evolutionary importance of this innovation. PML5 is thus a naturally occurring CNL variant with a minimal signaling domain and its further study should help in understanding the functional importance of this minimal domain for NLR signaling.",

However, the precise role this hormone plays in the cell-specific events during lateral root formation, rhizobial infection and nodule organogenesis, including interactions with auxin and cytokinin, is not clear. In this study, we performed epidermal- and endodermal-specific complementation of the severely gibberellin-deficient na pea (Pisum sativum) mutant with Agrobacterium rhizogenes. Gibberellin mutants were used to examine the spatial expression pattern of cytokinin (TCSn) and auxin (DR5) responsive promoters and hormone levels. We found that gibberellins produced in the endodermis promotes lateral root and nodule organogenesis and can induce a mobile signal(s) that suppresses rhizobial infection. In contrast, epidermal-derived gibberellins suppress infection but have little influence on root or nodule development. Gibberellins suppress the cytokinin-responsive TCSn promoter in the cortex and are required for normal auxin activation during nodule primordia formation. Our findings indicate that GA regulates the checkpoints between infection thread penetration of the cortex and invasion of nodule primordial cells, and also promotes the subsequent progression of nodule development. It appears that GA may limit the progression and branching of infection threads in the cortex by restricting cytokinin response and may activate auxin response to promote nodule primordia development.",

This study aimed to investigate for the first time the morphological, seeding pattern, and biochemical, variations within 133 populations of Assam lemon cultivar growing across 22 districts of Assam, India, and including control population, with the objective to offer comprehensive understanding that could facilitate the improvement of breeding programs and further improvement of this important cultivar. Using the dendrogram-based UPGMA algorithm, morphological and seeding pattern data were analyzed at both district and population levels. The resulting dendrograms revealed two major clusters, where all the populations of Upper Assam districts were in the same cluster with the original stock (control population). However, populations from Tinsukia and Dhemaji districts displayed more close similarities with the control population in comparison to other populations of Upper Assam districts. Another interesting observation was regarding flowering patterns, while some populations displayed both bisexual and unisexual flowers with less concentration of unisexual flowers, others had bisexual and unisexual flowers of almost equal concentration. Unisexual flowers contained only the male reproductive organs with 40 anthers, while bisexual flowers had 36 anthers. Seeding patterns were examined across the districts, and it was found that populations from Tinsukia, Dhemaji, Lakhimpur, Dibrugarh, Jorhat, and the control population exhibited seedless characteristic while populations from other selected districts displayed a combination of seedless and seeded traits. Interestingly, Golaghat district appears as the linking district and showed availability of both seeded and seedless Assam lemon fruit, connecting the regions of Upper, Central, Lower and North Assam and Barak valley. Biochemical analysis showed significant variations across districts, however, the populations from Dhemaji, Tinsukia, Lakhimpur, Dibrugarh, and Jorhat districts displayed similarity with the control population. The study also investigated variability in soil nutrient content revealing substantial variation among the populations studied, potentially influencing observed morphological variations. This comprehensive investigation provides valuable insights into the morphological, seeding pattern, and biochemical diversity within the Assam lemon cultivar. These findings can be instrumental in breeding programs to enhance this Citrus cultivar, particularly in producing high-quality seedless fruits to meet consumer demands.",

Here, we aim to understand the historical causes of the latitudinal polyploidy gradient using a combination of ancestral state reconstruction methods. Specifically, we assess whether (1) polyploidization enables movement to higher latitudes (i.e., polyploidization precedes occurrences in higher latitudes) or (2) higher latitudes facilitate polyploidization (i.e., occurrence in higher latitudes precedes polyploidization). We reconstruct the ploidy states and ancestral niches of 1,032 angiosperm species at four paleoclimatic time slices ranging from 3.3 million years ago to the present, comprising taxa from four well-represented clades: Onagraceae, Primulaceae, Solanum (Solanaceae), and Pooideae (Poaceae). We use ancestral niche reconstruction models alongside a customized discrete character evolution model to allow reconstruction of states at specific time slices. Patterns of latitudinal movement are reconstructed and compared in relation to inferred ploidy shifts. We find that no single hypothesis applies equally well across all analyzed clades. While significant differences in median latitudinal occurrence were detected in the largest clade, Pooideae, no significant differences were detected in latitudinal movement in any clade. Our preliminary study is the first to attempt to connect ploidy changes to continuous latitudinal movement, but we cannot favor one hypothesis over another. Given that patterns seem to be clade-specific, a larger number of clades must be analyzed in future studies for generalities to be drawn.",

Comparison of all four studied GRXs for their oxidoreductase function highlights biochemical diversification with GRXC1 and GRXC2 being better reductants than GRXC3 and GRXC4 with bis(2-hydroxyethyl) disulfide and oxidized roGFP2 as substrates. Vice versa, GRXC3 and GRXC4 are better oxidants of reduced roGFP2 in the reverse reaction.

        "abstract": "Speed breeding is a powerful tool to accelerate breeding and research programmes by shortening generation time and has been widely adopted for a range of crop species. Despite its success and growing popularity with breeders the genetic basis of plant development under speed breeding remains unknown. In this study, we explored how genotypes respond in terms of developmental advancement under different photoperiod regimes in the context of speed breeding. A subset of the barley HEB-25 Nested Association Mapping population was evaluated for days to heading and maturity under two contrasting photoperiod conditions: 1) Speed Breeding (SB) consisting of 22 hours of light and 2 hours of darkness), and 2) Normal Breeding (NB) consisting of 16 hours of light and 8 hours of darkness. GWAS revealed that developmental responses under both conditions were largely controlled by two loci: PPDH-1 and ELF3. Allelic variants at these genes determine whether plants display early flowering and maturity under both NB and SB. At key QTL regions, domesticated alleles were associated with late flowering and maturity in NB and early flowering and maturity in SB, whereas wild alleles were associated with early flowering under both conditions. We hypothesise that this may be related to the dark dependent repression of PPD-H1 by ELF3 which might be more prominent in NB conditions. Furthermore, by comparing development under two contrasting photoperiod regimes, we were able to derive an estimate of plasticity for the two traits. Interestingly, plasticity in development was largely attributed to allelic variation at ELF3. Our results have important implications for our understanding and optimisation of speed breeding protocols particularly when incorporating genetics from wild relatives into breeding programmes and the design of breeding programmes to support the delivery of climate resilient crops.",

Previously, we demonstrated that inhibition of protein geranylgeranyl transferase (PGGT-I) negatively impacts the biosynthesis of monoterpenoid indole alkaloids (MIA) in Catharanthus roseus, indicating the involvement of prenylated proteins in signaling. Here, we show through biochemical, molecular and in planta approaches that specific geranylgeranylated ROPs modulate C. roseus MIA biosynthesis. Among the six C. roseus ROP GTPases (CrROPs), only CrROP3 and CrROP5, having a C-terminal CSIL motif, were specifically prenylated by PGGT-I. Additionally, both of their transcripts showed higher expression in most parts compared to other CrROPs. Protein-protein interaction studies revealed that both CrROP3 and CrROP5, but not CrROP2 (lacking CSIL motif), interacted with CrPGGT-I. Further, CrROP3 and CrROP5 exhibited nuclear localization, whereas CrROP2 was localized to plasma membrane. In planta functional studies revealed that silencing of CrROP3 and CrROP5 negatively affected MIA biosynthesis, while their overexpression upregulated MIA formation. In contrast, silencing and overexpression of CrROP2 had no effect on MIA biosynthesis. Moreover, overexpression of deltaCrROP3 and deltaCrROP5 mutants lacking the CSIL motif failed to enhance MIA biosynthesis. Taken together, these results implicate that CrROP3 and CrROP5 have positive regulatory role on MIA biosynthesis and thus shed light on how geranylgeranylated ROP GTPases mediate the modulation of specialized metabolism in C. roseus.",

Arabidopsis CML13 and CML14 are closely related paralogs that interact with the isoleucine-glutamine (IQ) domains of myosins, IQ-domain (IQD) proteins, and CaM-activated transcription factors (CAMTAs). Here, we explored the physiological roles of CML13 and CML14 during development by using dexamethasone-inducible RNA silencing to suppress either CML13 or CML14 transcript levels. In the absence of inducible suppression, CML13- and CML14-RNA-interference lines were indistinguishable from WT plants throughout development. In contrast, induction of silencing treatment led to rapid increases in RNA-hairpin production that correlated with a targeted reduction in CML13 or CML14 transcript levels and a range of developmental and morphological effects. RNA suppression treatment did not impair the germination of CML13- or 14-RNA-interference lines, but these seedlings were chlorotic, displayed high mortality, and failed to achieve seedling establishment. Induced RNA suppression of mature plants led to reduced silique length, shorter roots, and rapid leaf senescence in CML13- and 14-RNA-interference plants. Plants induced for RNA suppression at 2 weeks post-germination exhibited a much stronger phenotype than treatment of 3-, 4-, or 5-week-old plants. Collectively, our data indicate that both CML13 and CML14 are essential for normal development and function across a broad range of tissues and developmental stages.

N. khasiana pitchers displayed below ambient temperatures during evening-night-morning hours (5 pm to 8-9-10 am); pitcher spots recorded lowest and highest temperatures as 14.4 (6-7 am) and 45.6{degrees}C (2 pm), respectively. The average humidities in the night and day periods were 77.15% and 50.15%, respectively. The prey capturing zones in Nepenthes pitchers (peristome, lid and their intersection) are colder favoring prey capture, whereas in thermogenic flowers, floral portions are hotter, providing the thermal requirements for the pollinator. In thermogenic plants, floral zones assist pollination by offering a  thermal reward through enzymatic processes; but Nepenthes traps achieve lower temperature spots by physical (surface microstructures), chemical (nectar) and ecological (rain, humidity) factors. Both are contrasting  life and  death adaptations in nature.",

In Asia, India is considered as one of the centers of origin of indica rice and has several native landraces, especially in North-Eastern India (NEI), which have the potential to cope with the negative impact of present-day climate change. The current investigation aimed to evaluate the NEI rice landraces potential under high temperatures and elevated CO2 levels in comparison with a check variety for phenological, morphological, physiological and yield-associated parameters and molecularly validated with marker-assisted genotyping. The initial experiment was carried out with 75 rice landraces to evaluate their high heat tolerance ability. Seven better-performing landraces along with the check variety (N22) were further evaluated for aforesaid traits across two years (2019 and 2020) under control (or T1) and two stress treatments - (i) mild stress or T2 [CO2 550 ppm + 4{degrees} C more than ambient temperature] and (ii) severe stress or T3 [CO2 750 ppm + 6{degrees} C more than ambient temperature] using bioreactors. In the molecular analysis, the eight selected genotypes were evaluated through 25 Start Codon Targeted (SCoT) markers. The results revealed that the mild stress (T2) had a positive impact on various morpho-physiological parameters like plant height, number of leaves, leaf area and yield parameters like spikelets panicle-1 (S/P), thousand-grain weight (TGW) and grain yield (GY). This effect could be attributed to the genotypes ability to maintain a higher photosynthetic rate and possess better tolerance ability to moderately high temperatures. However, under high-temperature conditions in T3, all genotypes exhibited a significant decrease in the studied parameters including GY. It was found that pollen traits were significantly and positively correlated to spikelet fertility% at maturity, which was further significantly associated with GY under applied stress conditions. The physiological traits including shoot biomass were evident to have a significant positive effect on yield-associated parameters like S/P, harvest index (HI), TGW and GY. Overall, two landraces Kohima special and Lisem were found to be better responsive compared to other landraces as well as the check variety N22 under stress conditions. SCoT genotyping amplified a total of 77 alleles out of which 55 were polymorphic with the PIC value ranging from 0.22 to 0.67. The investigation suggests the presence of genetic variation among the tested rice lines and further supports evidence of the closely relatedness of Kohima special and Lisem. These two are two better-performing rice landraces from North-East India based on their improving morpho-physiological parameters and yield attributes in mild and severe high temperature and elevated CO2 stress environments. The shortlisted two rice landraces can be used as valuable pre-breeding materials for future rice breeding programs to improve the stress tolerance properties, particularly to high temperatures and elevated CO2 levels under ongoing changing climatic scenarios.",

        "abstract": "Root gravitropic bending represents a fundamental aspect of terrestrial plant physiology. Gravity is perceived by sedimentation of starch-rich plastids (statoliths) to the bottom of the central root cap cells. Following gravity perception, intercellular auxin transport is redirected downwards leading to an asymmetric auxin accumulation at the lower root side causing inhibition of cell expansion, ultimately resulting in downwards bending. How gravity-induced statoliths repositioning is translated into asymmetric auxin distribution remains unclear despite PIN auxin efflux carriers and the Negative Gravitropic Response of roots (NGR) proteins polarize along statolith sedimentation, thus providing a plausible mechanism for auxin flow redirection. In this study, using a functional NGR1-GFP construct, we visualized the NGR1 localization on the statolith surface and plasma membrane (PM) domains in close proximity to the statoliths, correlating with their movements. We determined that NGR1 binding to these PM domains is indispensable for NGR1 functionality and relies on cysteine acylation and adjacent polybasic regions as well as on lipid and sterol PM composition. Detailed timing of the early events following graviperception suggested that both NGR1 repolarization and initial auxin asymmetry precede the visible PIN3 polarization. This discrepancy motivated us to unveil a rapid, NGR-dependent translocation of PIN-activating AGCVIII kinase D6PK towards lower PMs of gravity-perceiving cells, thus providing an attractive model for rapid redirection of auxin fluxes following gravistimulation.",

        "abstract": "Abstract/SummaryThe cucumber mosaic virus (CMV) 2b protein is a potent counter-defense protein and symptom determinant that inhibits antiviral silencing by titration of short double-stranded RNAs. Expression of the 2b protein from the CMV Subgroup IA strain Fny-CMV in transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana plants disrupts microRNA-mediated cleavage of host mRNAs by binding ARGONAUTE 1 (AGO1), leading to symptom-like phenotypes. This also triggers AGO2-mediated resistance against CMV and strong resistance to CMVs aphid vectors, which would be deleterious to viral fitness. However, in authentic viral infections the Fny-CMV 1a protein modulates 2b-AGO1 interactions, which inhibits induction of AGO2-mediated virus resistance and resistance to aphid vectors. Contrastingly, the 2b proteins encoded by the Subgroup II LS-CMV strain or the recently discovered Subgroup IA strain Ho-CMV induce no apparent symptoms. Confocal laser scanning microscopy, bimolecular fluorescence complementation and co-immunoprecipitation showed that the Fny-CMV and Ho-CMV 2b proteins interact with the Fny-CMV and LS-CMV 1a proteins whilst the CMV-LS 2b protein does not. However, the Fny-CMV, Ho-CMV and LS-CMV 2b proteins all interacted with AGO1, but while AGO1-Fny2b complexes occurred in the host cell nucleus and cytoplasm, the corresponding AGO1-2b complexes for LS-CMV and Ho-CMV accumulated almost exclusively in nuclei. AGO2 transcript accumulation was used to assess the inhibition of AGO1-mediated miRNA-regulated mRNA cleavage. While Fny-CMV 2b induced a five-fold increase in AGO2 accumulation, the LS-CMV and Ho-CMV 2b proteins induced only two-fold increases. Thus, these 2b proteins bind AGO1 but are less effective at inhibiting AGO1 activity. We conclude that the intracellular localization sites of 2b-AGO1 complexes influences the degree to which a 2b protein can inhibit microRNA-mediated host mRNA degradation and that cytoplasmic AGO1 has the strongest influence on miRNA-mediated cellular mRNA turnover.",

        "abstract": "The multifaceted role of pathogen-encoded effectors in plant-pathogen interactions is complex and not fully understood. Effectors operate within intricate host environments, interacting with host proteins and other effectors to modulate virulence. The complex interplay between effectors raises the concept of metaeffectors, where some effectors regulate the activity of others. While previous research has demonstrated the importance of effector repertoires in pathogen virulence, only a limited number of studies have investigated the interactions between these effectors. This study explores the interactions among Phakopsora pachyrhizi effector candidates (PpECs). P. pachyrhizi haustorial transcriptome analysis identified a collection of predicted PpECs. Among these, PpEC23 was found to interact with PpEC48, prompting further exploration into their potential interaction with other effectors. Here, we utilized a yeast-two-hybrid screen to explore protein-protein interactions between PpECs. A split-luciferase complementation assay also demonstrated that these interactions could occur within soybean cells. Interestingly, PpEC48 displayed the ability to interact with several small cysteine-rich proteins (SCRP), suggesting its affinity for this specific class of effectors. We show that these interactions involve a histidine-rich domain within PpEC48, emphasizing the significance of structural motifs in mediating effector interactions. The unique nature of PpEC48, showing no sequence matches in other organisms, suggests its relatively recent evolution and potential orphan gene status. Our work reveals insights into the intricate network of interactions among P. pachyrhizi effector-effector interactions.",

One way to tackle this is to screen novel resistant genotypes and immunity-inducing agents, which must be conducted in a high-throughput manner. Colour-analyzer is a free web-based tool that can be used to rapidly measure the formation of lesions on leaves. Pixel colour values are often used to distinguish infected from healthy tissues. Some programs employ colour models, such as RGB, HSV or L*a*b*. Colour-analyzer uses two colour models, utilizing both HSV (Hue, Saturation, Value) and L*a*b* values. We found that the a* b* values of the L*a*b* colour model provided the clearest distinction between infected and healthy tissue, while the H and S channels were best to distinguish the leaf area from the background. By combining the a* and b* channels to determine the lesion area, while using the H and S channels to determine the leaf area, Colour-analyzer provides highly accurate information on the size of the lesion as well as the percentage of infected tissue in a high throughput manner and can accelerate the plant immunity research field.",

Mitochondrial Fe-S cluster assembly occurs in two major steps to first build [2Fe-2S] clusters and subsequently assemble these into [4Fe-4S] clusters. The two assembly machineries are interconnected by glutaredoxin S15 (GRXS15) that transfers [2Fe-2S] clusters to the second machinery. Diminished cluster transfer activity of GRXS15 in Arabidopsis mitochondria causes specific defects associated with lipoyl synthase (LIP1) activity. Conversely, overexpression of LIP1 in wild-type plants causes the release of toxic amounts of sulfide that can be detoxified by increasing the capacity for sulfide fixation through overexpression of O-acetylserine-(thiol)-lyase. The release of sulfide by lipoyl synthase causes a disturbance of mitochondrial sulfide homeostasis resulting in distinct and readily observable macroscopic phenotypes.

In imprinting, uniparental gene expression arises due to parent-specific epigenetic marks on one allele but not on the other. The importance of sRNAs and their regulation in endosperm development or in imprinting is poorly understood in crops. Here we show that a previously uncharacterized CLASSY (CLSY)-family chromatin remodeler named OsCLSY3 is essential for rice endosperm development and imprinting, acting as an upstream player in sRNA pathway. Comparative transcriptome and genetic analysis indicated its endosperm-preferred expression and its paternally imprinted nature. These important features were modulated by RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM) of tandemly arranged TEs in its promoter. Upon perturbation of OsCLSY3 in transgenic lines we observed defects in endosperm development and loss of around 70% of all sRNAs. Interestingly, well-conserved endosperm-specific sRNAs (siren) that are vital for reproductive fitness in angiosperms were dependent on OsCLSY3. We also observed many imprinted genes and seed development-associated genes under the control of CLSY3-dependent RdDM. These results support an essential role of OsCLSY3 in rice endosperm development and imprinting, and propose similar regulatory strategies involving CLSY3 homologs among other cereals.

These machine learning models identified early transcriptional responses predictive of later disease development, regardless of pathogen class, using a fraction of the host transcriptome. The identified gene sets were not enriched for canonical defense genes, but where statistically enriched for genes previously identified from independent data sets, including those described as representing a general plant stress response.

Emerging evidence shows that epigenetic regulation is an important component of the transcriptional reprogramming during stress. Despite this, the overall stress-induced reprogramming of the different epigenetic marks and their targets are unknown.

We find that cucumber mosaic virus (CMV) infection induces an overall reorganization of the repressive epigenetic marks H3K9me2, H3K27me3, and DNA methylation, which interact between them and are dynamic during infection. Overall, these epigenetic changes are involved in the reprogramming of the transcriptional program to adapt to the biotic stress, and might ensure genome stability through the transcriptional control of transposable elements (TEs).

Within the auxin-mimic herbicide class, the herbicide fluroxypyr has been extensively used to control an agronomically problematic Great Plains tumbleweed, kochia (Bassia scoparia). A 2014 field survey for herbicide resistance in kochia populations across Colorado identified a putative fluroxypyr resistant population that was assessed for response to five different herbicides representing four different herbicide modes of action. These included fluroxypyr and dicamba (auxin-mimics), atrazine (photosystem II inhibitor), glyphosate (EPSPS inhibitor), and chlorsulfuron (acetolactate synthase inhibitor). The greenhouse screen identified that this kochia population was resistant to fluroxypyr and chlorsulfuron, but sensitive to glyphosate, atrazine, and dicamba. This population was designated Flur-R. Subsequent dose response studies determined that 75% of the Flur-R population survived 628 g ae ha-1 of fluroxypyr (4x the label application rate in wheat fallow, which is 157 g ae ha-1 at 1x). Flur-R was 40 times more resistant to fluroxypyr than a susceptible population (J01-S) collected from the same field survey (LD50 720 and 20 g ae ha-1, respectively). Auxin-responsive gene expression increased following fluroxypyr treatment in Flur-R, J01-S, and in a dicamba-resistant, fluroxypyr-susceptible line 9425 in an RNA-sequencing experiment. In Flur-R, several transcripts with molecular functions for conjugation and transport were constitutively higher expressed, such as glutathione S-transferases (GSTs), UDP-glucosyl transferase (GT), and ATP binding cassette transporters (ABC transporters). After analyzing metabolic profiles over time, both Flur-R and J01-S rapidly converted [14C]-fluroxypyr ester, the herbicide formulation applied to plants, to [14C]-fluroxypyr acid, the biologically active form of the herbicide, and three unknown metabolites. Formation and flux of these metabolites was faster in Flur-R than J01-S, reducing the concentration of phytotoxic fluroxypyr acid. One unique metabolite was present in Flur-R that was not present in the J01-S metabolic profile. Gene sequence variant analysis specifically for auxin receptor and signaling proteins revealed the absence of non-synonymous mutations affecting auxin signaling and binding in candidate auxin target site genes, further supporting our hypothesis that non-target site metabolic degradation is contributing to fluroxypyr resistance in Flur-R.",

        "abstract": "Paramutation is the transfer of mitotically and meiotically heritable silencing information between two alleles. With paramutation at the maize booster1 (b1) locus, the low expressed B epiallele heritably changes the high expressed B-I epiallele into B with 100% frequency. This requires specific tandem repeats and multiple components of the RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM) pathway, including the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP, mediator of paramutation1, MOP1), the second-largest subunit of RNA polymerase IV and V (NRP(D/E)2a, mediator of paramutation2, MOP2), and the largest subunit of RNA Polymerase IV (NRPD1, mediator of paramutation3, MOP3). Mutations in mop genes prevent paramutation and release silencing at the B epiallele. In this study we investigated the effect of mutations in mop1, mop2 and mop3 on chromatin structure and DNA methylation at the B epiallele, and especially the regulatory hepta-repeat 100 kb upstream of the b1 gene.  We show that mutations in mop1 and mop3 result in decreased repressive histone modifications H3K9me2 and H3K27me2 at the hepta-repeat. Associated with this decrease are partial activation of the hepta-repeat enhancer function, formation of a multi-loop structure, and elevated b1 expression. In mop2 mutants, which do not show elevated b1 expression, H3K9me2 and H3K27me2 and a single-loop structure like in wild type B are retained. Surprisingly, high DNA methylation levels at the B hepta-repeat remains in all three mutants. Our results raise the possibility of MOP factors mediating RNA-directed histone methylation rather than RNA-directed DNA methylation at the b1 locus.",

Silene latifolia is a model dioecious plant whose sexuality is genetically regulated by X/Y chromosomes; however, anther smut fungus mimics the plant Y chromosome and forcibly converts female plants to male. Here, transcriptome analyses of healthy or fungus-infected S. latifolia inflorescence meristems suggested that an orthologue of AGL24 (SlAGL24), a flowering activator, is a key factor in sex conversion via fungus infection. Overexpression of SlAGL24 in Arabidopsis thaliana suppressed stamen development, whereas knock-down of SlAGL24 in S. latifolia converted males into hermaphrodites. Furthermore, SlAGL24 expression affected sexual dimorphisms in S. latifolia. Our results propose an adaptive scenario wherein the anther smut fungus targets SlAGL24, as a master regulator connecting the fungal signal to sex determination, to confer male and potentially male-beneficial traits, effectively transmitting its teliospores.",

This parameter represents a country's ability to generate international trade by utilizing its GDP. This figure is equivalent to GDP per capita, which represents a country's ability to use its population to generate GDP. Trade strength varies by country. The intriguing question is, what distribution function does the trade strength fulfill? In this paper, a theoretical foundation for predicting the distribution of trade strength and the rate of change of trade strength were developed. These two quantities were found to satisfy the Pareto distribution function. The equations were confirmed using data from the World Integrated Trade Solution (WITS) and the World Bank by comparing the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) to five types of distribution functions (exponential, lognormal, gamma, Pareto, and Weibull). I also discovered that the fitting Pareto power parameter is fairly close to the theoretical parameter. In addition, a formula for forecasting a country's total international trade in the following years was also developed.",

        "abstract": "Causal machine learning methods which flexibly generate heterogeneous treatment effect estimates could be very useful tools for governments trying to make and implement policy. However, as the critical artificial intelligence literature has shown, governments must be very careful of unintended consequences when using machine learning models. One way to try and protect against unintended bad outcomes is with AI Fairness methods which seek to create machine learning models where sensitive variables like race or gender do not influence outcomes. In this paper we argue that standard AI Fairness approaches developed for predictive machine learning are not suitable for all causal machine learning applications because causal machine learning generally (at least so far) uses modelling to inform a human who is the ultimate decision-maker while AI Fairness approaches assume a model that is making decisions directly. We define these scenarios as indirect and direct decision-making respectively and suggest that policy-making is best seen as a joint decision where the causal machine learning model usually only has indirect power. We lay out a definition of fairness for this scenario - a model that provides the information a decision-maker needs to accurately make a value judgement about just policy outcomes - and argue that the complexity of causal machine learning models can make this difficult to achieve. The solution here is not traditional AI Fairness adjustments, but careful modelling and awareness of some of the decision-making biases that these methods might encourage which we describe.",

Each agent's intrinsic factor is modeled as a private random variable, and the external control factor is modeled as a solution of the designer's optimization problem. The advantage of the type-adjustable mechanism is that by choosing an optimal value of control factor as public information, the designer may obtain Pareto-optimal outcomes, beneficial not only to herself but also to all agents. As a comparison, in an auction with interdependent values where the public information is represented as a random variable, only the seller will benefit from public information.

        "abstract": "A number of citation indices have been proposed for measuring and ranking the research publication records of scholars. Some of the best known indices, such as those proposed by Hirsch and Woeginger, are designed to reward most highly those records that strike some balance between productivity (number of papers published), and impact (frequency with which those papers are cited). A large number of rarely cited publications will not score well, nor will a very small number of heavily cited papers. We discuss three new citation indices, one of which was independently proposed in \\cite{FHLB}. Each rests on the notion of scale invariance, fundamental to John Nash's solution of the two-person bargaining problem. Our main focus is on one of these -- a scale invariant version of the Hirsch index. We argue that it has advantages over the original; it produces fairer rankings within subdisciplines, is more decisive (discriminates more finely, yielding fewer ties) and more dynamic (growing over time via more frequent, smaller increments), and exhibits enhanced centrality and tail balancedness. Simulations suggest that scale invariance improves robustness under Poisson noise, with increased decisiveness having no cost in terms of the number of ``accidental\" reversals, wherein random irregularities cause researcher A to receive a lower index value than B, although A's productivity and impact are both slightly higher than B's. Moreover, we provide an axiomatic characterization of the scale invariant Hirsch index, via axioms that bear a close relationship, in discrete analogue, to those used by Nash in \\cite{Nas50}. This argues for the mathematical naturality of the new index.  An earlier version was presented at the 5th World Congress of the Game Theory Society, Maastricht, Netherlands in 2016.",

As a consequence, exact estimation of latent diffusion models with more than one round of interaction is computationally infeasible. In the present paper, I propose a trimming estimator that enables me to establish and maximize an approximate log likelihood function that almost exactly identifies the peak of the true log likelihood function whenever no more than one third of eligible agents are subject to trimming.",

We find that (i) when lottery outcomes comprise gains and losses (experiment 1), exposing subjects to the CBS technology systematically makes them choose safer lotteries, compared to the subjects that are exposed to the other technologies, and (ii) when lottery outcomes comprise gains only (experiment 2), the above results are reversed: exposing subjects to the CBS technology systematically makes them choose riskier lotteries. By combining the information-search and choice analysis, we offer an interpretation of our results that is based on prospect theory, whereby the information-search technology subjects are exposed to contributes to determine the level of attention that the lottery attributes receive, which in turn has an effect on the reference point.",

The standard nonhomoskedasticity robust F-statistic is a member of this class. The associated GMMf estimator, with the extension f for first-stage, is a novel and unusual estimator as the weight matrix is based on the first-stage residuals. As the robust F-statistic can also be used as a test for underidentification, expressions for the calculation of the weak-instruments critical values in terms of the Nagar bias of the GMMf estimator relative to the benchmark simplify and no simulation methods or Patnaik (1949) distributional approximations are needed. In the grouped-data IV designs of Andrews (2018), where the robust F-statistic is large but the effective F-statistic is small, the GMMf estimator is shown to behave much better in terms of bias than the 2SLS estimator, as expected by the weak-instruments test results.",

This paper aims to provide in a step-by-step manner how U-statistics tools can be applied to obtain the asymptotic properties of pairwise differences estimators for a two-way fixed effects model of dyadic interactions. More specifically, we first propose an estimator for the model that relies on pairwise differencing such that the fixed effects are differenced out. As a result, the summands of the influence function will not be independent anymore, showing dependence on the individual level and translating to the fact that the usual law of large numbers and central limit theorems do not straightforwardly apply. To overcome such obstacles, we show how to generalize tools of U-statistics for single-index variables to the double-indices context of dyadic datasets. A key result is that there can be different ways of defining the Hajek projection for a directed dyadic structure, which will lead to distinct, but equivalent, consistent estimators for the asymptotic variances.

By making a rank invariance assumption, we can reformulate the proportional hazards model into a semiparametric version of the instrumental variable quantile regression model of Chernozhukov and Hansen (2005). A na\\\"ive estimation approach based on conditional moment conditions generated by the model would lead to a highly nonconvex and nonsmooth objective function. To overcome this problem, we propose a new presmoothing methodology. First, we estimate the model nonparametrically - and show that this nonparametric estimator has a closed-form solution in the leading case of interest of randomized experiments with one-sided noncompliance. Second, we use the nonparametric estimator to generate ``proxy'' observations for which exogeneity holds. Third, we apply the usual partial likelihood estimator to the ``proxy'' data. While the paper focuses on the proportional hazards model, our presmoothing approach could be applied to estimate other semiparametric formulations of the instrumental variable quantile regression model. Our estimation procedure allows for random right-censoring. We show asymptotic normality of the resulting estimator.

Our findings uncover intricate trading dynamics among the U.S., China, and Southeast Asia, through which businesses relocated portions of their global supply chain away from China to avoid high tariffs. Our analysis indicates that increased tariffs cause the U.S. to import less from China. Meanwhile, Southeast Asian exporters have integrated more into value chains centered on Chinese suppliers by participating more in assembling and completing products. However, the worldwide lockdowns over pandemic have reversed this trend as, over this period, the U.S. effectively imported more goods directly from China and indirectly through Southeast Asian exporters that imported from China.",

However, in the worst-case emissions scenario these values increase to 3.02$\\pm$1.48 tonnes for Kuiper, 1.7$\\pm$0.71 tonnes for OneWeb and 1.04$\\pm$0.33 tonnes CO$_2$eq/subscriber for Starlink, more than 31-91 times higher than equivalent terrestrial mobile broadband. Importantly, phase 2 constellations propose to increase the number of satellites by an order-of-magnitude higher, highlighting the pressing need to mitigate negative environmental impacts. Strategic choices in rocket design and fuel options can help to substantially mitigate negative sustainability impacts.",

        "abstract": "We argue for the application of bibliometric indices to quantify the long-term uncertainty of outcome in sports. The Euclidean index is proposed to reward quality over quantity, while the rectangle index can be an appropriate measure of core performance. Their differences are highlighted through an axiomatic analysis and several examples. Our approach also requires a weighting scheme to compare different achievements. The methodology is illustrated by studying the knockout stage of the UEFA Champions League in the 20 seasons played between 2003 and 2023: club and country performances as well as three types of competitive balance are considered. Measuring competition at the level of national associations is a novelty. All results are remarkably robust concerning the bibliometric index and the assigned weights. Since the performances of national associations are more stable than the results of individual clubs, it would be better to build the seeding in the UEFA Champions League group stage upon association coefficients adjusted for league finishing positions rather than club coefficients.",

        "abstract": "When does society eventually learn the truth, or take the correct action, via observational learning? In a general model of sequential learning over social networks, we identify a simple condition for learning dubbed excludability. Excludability is a joint property of agents' preferences and their information. When required to hold for all preferences, it is equivalent to information having \"unbounded beliefs\", which demands that any agent can individually identify the truth, even if only with small probability. But unbounded beliefs may be untenable with more than two states: e.g., it is incompatible with the monotone likelihood ratio property. Excludability reveals that what is crucial for learning, instead, is that a single agent must be able to displace any wrong action, even if she cannot take the correct action. We develop two classes of preferences and information that jointly satisfy excludability: (i) for a one-dimensional state, preferences with single-crossing differences and a new informational condition, directionally unbounded beliefs; and (ii) for a multi-dimensional state, Euclidean preferences and subexponential location-shift information.",

        "abstract": "We consider multi-population Bayesian games with a large number of players. Each player aims at minimizing a cost function that depends on this player's own action, the distribution of players' actions in all populations, and an unknown state parameter. We study the nonatomic limit versions of these games and introduce the concept of Bayes correlated Wardrop equilibrium, which extends the concept of Bayes correlated equilibrium to nonatomic games. We prove that Bayes correlated Wardrop equilibria are limits of action flows induced by Bayes correlated equilibria of the game with a large finite set of small players. For nonatomic games with complete information admitting a convex potential, we prove that the set of correlated and of coarse correlated Wardrop equilibria coincide with the set of probability distributions over Wardrop equilibria, and that all equilibrium outcomes have the same costs. We get the following consequences. First, all flow distributions of (coarse) correlated equilibria in convex potential games with finitely many players converge to Wardrop equilibria when the weight of each player tends to zero. Second, for any sequence of flows satisfying a no-regret property, its empirical distribution converges to the set of distributions over Wardrop equilibria and the average cost converges to the unique Wardrop cost.",

The Pareto frontier of this set can be recovered by a series of standard Bayesian persuasion problems, in which a utilitarian planner takes the role of the information designer. We provide necessary and sufficient conditions under which an information policy exists that Pareto dominates the no-information policy.

        "abstract": "Understanding variable dependence, particularly eliciting their statistical properties given a set of covariates, provides the mathematical foundation in practical operations management such as risk analysis and decision-making given observed circumstances. This article presents an estimation method for modeling the conditional joint distribution of bivariate outcomes based on the distribution regression and factorization methods. This method is considered semiparametric in that it allows for flexible modeling of both the marginal and joint distributions conditional on covariates without imposing global parametric assumptions across the entire distribution. In contrast to existing parametric approaches, our method can accommodate discrete, continuous, or mixed variables, and provides a simple yet effective way to capture distributional dependence structures between bivariate outcomes and covariates. Various simulation results confirm that our method can perform similarly or better in finite samples compared to the alternative methods. In an application to the study of a motor third-party liability insurance portfolio, the proposed method effectively estimates risk measures such as the conditional Value-at-Risk and Expected Shortfall. This result suggests that this semiparametric approach can serve as an alternative in insurance risk management.",

We also discuss implementation issues such as consistent estimation of the covariance function for the Gaussian approximation, optimal integrated mean squared error bandwidth selection, and valid robust bias-corrected inference. We illustrate the applicability of our results by constructing valid confidence bands and hypothesis tests for both parametric specification and shape constraints, explicitly characterizing their approximation errors.

        "abstract": "In school choice problems, the motivation for students' welfare (efficiency) is restrained by concerns to respect schools' priorities (fairness). Among the fair matchings, even the best one in terms of welfare (SOSM) is inefficient. Moreover, any mechanism that improves welfare over the SOSM is manipulable by the students. First, we characterize the \"least manipulable\" mechanisms in this class: monotonically-promoting transformation proofness ensures that no student is better off by promoting their assigned school under the true preferences. Second, we use the notion that a matching is less unfair if it yields a smaller set of students whose priorities are violated, and define minimal unfairness accordingly. We then show that the Efficiency Adjusted Deferred Acceptance (EADA) mechanism is minimally unfair in the class of efficient and monotonically-promoting transformation proof mechanisms. When the objective is to improve students' welfare over the SOSM, this characterization implies an important insight into the frontier of the main axioms in school choice.",

        "abstract": "While Nash equilibrium has emerged as the central game-theoretic solution concept, many important games contain several Nash equilibria and we must determine how to select between them in order to create real strategic agents. Several Nash equilibrium refinement concepts have been proposed and studied for sequential imperfect-information games, the most prominent being trembling-hand perfect equilibrium, quasi-perfect equilibrium, and recently one-sided quasi-perfect equilibrium. These concepts are robust to certain arbitrarily small mistakes, and are guaranteed to always exist; however, we argue that neither of these is the correct concept for developing strong agents in sequential games of imperfect information. We define a new equilibrium refinement concept for extensive-form games called observable perfect equilibrium in which the solution is robust over trembles in publicly-observable action probabilities (not necessarily over all action probabilities that may not be observable by opposing players). Observable perfect equilibrium correctly captures the assumption that the opponent is playing as rationally as possible given mistakes that have been observed (while previous solution concepts do not). We prove that observable perfect equilibrium is always guaranteed to exist, and demonstrate that it leads to a different solution than the prior extensive-form refinements in no-limit poker. We expect observable perfect equilibrium to be a useful equilibrium refinement concept for modeling many important imperfect-information games of interest in artificial intelligence.",

Our results allow for a more general dependence structure compared to previous works and are widely applicable to a variety of linear and nonlinear autoregressive processes. We demonstrate the validity of our proposed methodology by examining the finite-sample performance in the simulation study. Finally, an application in time series, the forward premium regression, is presented, where we construct the SCR for the foreign exchange risk premium from the exchange rate and macroeconomic data.",

When the number of moment conditions grows proportionally with the sample size, the large-dimensional weighting matrix prohibits the use of conventional asymptotic approximations and the behavior of these tests remains unknown. We show that the structure of the weighting matrix opens up an alternative route to asymptotic results when, under the null hypothesis, the distribution of the moment conditions is reflection invariant. In a heteroskedastic linear instrumental variables model, we then establish asymptotic normality of conventional tests statistics under many instrument sequences. A key result is that the additional terms that appear in the variance are negative. Revisiting a study on the elasticity of substitution between immigrant and native workers where the number of instruments is over a quarter of the sample size, the many instrument-robust approximation indeed leads to substantially narrower confidence intervals.",

We develop a simple contest model of bug bounty. A group of individuals of arbitrary size is invited to undertake a costly search for bugs. The individuals differ with regard to their abilities, which we capture by different costs to achieve a certain probability to find bugs if any exist. Costs are private information. We study equilibria of the contest and characterize the optimal design of bug bounty schemes. In particular, the designer can vary the size of the group of individuals invited to search, add a paid expert, insert an artificial bug with some probability, and pay multiple prizes.",

(2018) by integrating a heterogeneous range of ages for a child, covering her growth from infancy to adulthood. The outcomes derived from the model are then aligned with actual data through a fitting process, followed by simulations of policies catering to married couples' varying educational backgrounds. Our model's calculations indicate a reduction in maternal earnings after childbirth, consistent with the findings of the empirical investigation known as the \"child penalty.\" However, a notable disparity emerges between the projected outcomes of the model and the observed data during the subsequent phase of maternal earnings recovery, with a discrepancy of approximately 40 %. Furthermore, our calculations demonstrate that a 25 % increase in the income replacement rate for parental leave results in an almost 20 % increase in the utilization of parental leave. In contrast, a steady 10 % rise in wages leads to a modest 2.5 % increase in the utilization of parental leave.",

Whilst numerous prior works attempt to explain the decline via economic factors, our novel approach links the decline to biological factors. Specifically, we propose a theoretical macroeconomic model where labor share reflects a dynamic equilibrium between the workforce automating existing outputs, and consumers demanding new output variants that require human labor. Industrialization leads to an aging population, and while cognitive performance is stable in the working years it drops sharply thereafter. Consequently, the declining cognitive performance of aging consumers reduces the demand for new output variants, leading to a decline in labor share. Our model expresses labor share as an algebraic function of median age, and is validated with surprising accuracy on historical data across industrialized economies via non-linear stochastic regression.",
