Facilitating the integration of a dataset with other types of data increases the likelihood of reuse, and the potential of answering novel research questions. Ontologies are a useful tool for semantically tagging datasets as adding relevant metadata increases the understanding of how data was produced and increases its interoperability. Ontologies provide concepts for a particular domain as well as the relationships between concepts. By tagging data with ontology terms, data becomes both human and machine interpretable, allowing for increased reuse and interoperability. However, the task of identifying ontologies relevant to a particular research domain or technology is challenging, especially within the diverse realm of fundamental plant research. In this review, we outline the ontologies most relevant to the fundamental plant sciences and how they can be used to annotate data related to plant-specific experiments within metadata frameworks, such as Investigation-Study-Assay (ISA). We also outline repositories and platforms most useful for identifying applicable ontologies or finding ontology terms.","creator":"Kathryn Dumschott, Hannah D&#xf6;rpholz, Marie-Ang&#xe9;lique Laporte, Dominik Brilhaus, Andrea Schrader, Bj&#xf6;rn Usadel, Steffen Neumann, Elizabeth Arnaud, Angela Kranz"},{"id":"2309.07136","slug":"masked-transformer-for-electrocardiogram-classification-arxiv-2309-07136v1-eess-sp","title":"Masked Transformer for Electrocardiogram Classification.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07136","abstract":"Electrocardiogram (ECG) is one of the most important diagnostic tools in clinical applications.

Deep neural networks (DNNs) have received super performance in solving PDEs in addition to their outstanding success in areas such as natural language processing, computer vision, and robotics. However, training a very deep network is often a challenging task. As the number of layers of a DNN increases, solving a large-scale non-convex optimization problem that results in the DNN solution of PDEs becomes more and more difficult, which may lead to a decrease rather than an increase in predictive accuracy. To overcome this challenge, we propose a two-stage multi-grade deep learning (TS-MGDL) method that breaks down the task of learning a DNN into several neural networks stacked on top of each other in a staircase-like manner. This approach allows us to mitigate the complexity of solving the non-convex optimization problem with large number of parameters and learn residual components left over from previous grades efficiently. We prove that each grade/stage of the proposed TS-MGDL method can reduce the value of the loss function and further validate this fact through numerical experiments. Although the proposed method is applicable to general PDEs, implementation in this paper focuses only on the 1D, 2D, and 3D viscous Burgers equations. Experimental results show that the proposed two-stage multi-grade deep learning method enables efficient learning of solutions of the equations and outperforms existing single-grade deep learning methods in predictive accuracy. Specifically, the predictive errors of the single-grade deep learning are larger than those of the TS-MGDL method in 26-60, 4-31 and 3-12 times, for the 1D, 2D, and 3D equations, respectively.","creator":"Yuesheng Xu, Taishan Zeng"},{"id":"2309.07405","slug":"funcodec-a-fundamental-reproducible-and-integrable-open-source-toolkit-for-neural-speech-codec-arxiv-2309-07405v1-cs-sd","title":"FunCodec: A Fundamental, Reproducible and Integrable Open-source Toolkit for Neural Speech Codec.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07405","abstract":"This paper presents FunCodec, a fundamental neural speech codec toolkit, which is an extension of the open-source speech processing toolkit FunASR.

However, most existing GIAs necessitate control over the server and rely on strong prior knowledge including batch normalization and data distribution information. In this work, we propose Client-side poisoning Gradient Inversion (CGI), which is a novel attack method that can be launched from clients. For the first time, we show the feasibility of a client-side adversary with limited knowledge being able to recover the training samples from the aggregated global model. We take a distinct approach in which the adversary utilizes a malicious model that amplifies the loss of a specific targeted class of interest. When honest clients employ the poisoned global model, the gradients of samples belonging to the targeted class are magnified, making them the dominant factor in the aggregated update. This enables the adversary to effectively reconstruct the private input belonging to other clients using the aggregated update. In addition, our CGI also features its ability to remain stealthy against Byzantine-robust aggregation rules (AGRs). By optimizing malicious updates and blending benign updates with a malicious replacement vector, our method remains undetected by these defense mechanisms. To evaluate the performance of CGI, we conduct experiments on various benchmark datasets, considering representative Byzantine-robust AGRs, and exploring diverse FL settings with different levels of adversary knowledge about the data.

Hence, a logic system could naturally be incorporated for the reasoning in a recommendation task. However, although hard-rule approaches based on logic systems can provide powerful reasoning ability, they struggle to cope with inconsistent and incomplete knowledge in real-world tasks, especially for complex tasks such as recommendation. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a neuro-symbolic recommendation model, which transforms the user history interactions into a logic expression and then transforms the recommendation prediction into a query task based on this logic expression. The logic expressions are then computed based on the modular logic operations of the neural network. We also construct an implicit logic encoder to reasonably reduce the complexity of the logic computation. Finally, a user's interest items can be queried in the vector space based on the computation results. Experiments on three well-known datasets verified that our method performs better compared to state of the art shallow, deep, session, and reasoning models.","creator":"Maonian Wu, Bang Chen, Shaojun Zhu, Bo Zheng, Wei Peng, Mingyi Zhang"},{"id":"2309.07597","slug":"c-pack-packaged-resources-to-advance-general-chinese-embedding-arxiv-2309-07597v1-cs-cl","title":"C-Pack: Packaged Resources To Advance General Chinese Embedding.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07597","abstract":"We introduce C-Pack, a package of resources that significantly advance the field of general Chinese embeddings.

AI agents are artificial entities that sense their environment, make decisions, and take actions. Many efforts have been made to develop intelligent AI agents since the mid-20th century. However, these efforts have mainly focused on advancement in algorithms or training strategies to enhance specific capabilities or performance on particular tasks. Actually, what the community lacks is a sufficiently general and powerful model to serve as a starting point for designing AI agents that can adapt to diverse scenarios. Due to the versatile and remarkable capabilities they demonstrate, large language models (LLMs) are regarded as potential sparks for Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), offering hope for building general AI agents. Many research efforts have leveraged LLMs as the foundation to build AI agents and have achieved significant progress. We start by tracing the concept of agents from its philosophical origins to its development in AI, and explain why LLMs are suitable foundations for AI agents. Building upon this, we present a conceptual framework for LLM-based agents, comprising three main components: brain, perception, and action, and the framework can be tailored to suit different applications. Subsequently, we explore the extensive applications of LLM-based agents in three aspects: single-agent scenarios, multi-agent scenarios, and human-agent cooperation. Following this, we delve into agent societies, exploring the behavior and personality of LLM-based agents, the social phenomena that emerge when they form societies, and the insights they offer for human society.

Using scaled and shifted beta distributions, beta diffusion utilizes multiplicative transitions over time to create both forward and reverse diffusion processes, maintaining beta distributions in both the forward marginals and the reverse conditionals, given the data at any point in time. Unlike traditional diffusion-based generative models relying on additive Gaussian noise and reweighted evidence lower bounds (ELBOs), beta diffusion is multiplicative and optimized with KL-divergence upper bounds (KLUBs) derived from the convexity of the KL divergence. We demonstrate that the proposed KLUBs are more effective for optimizing beta diffusion compared to negative ELBOs, which can also be derived as the KLUBs of the same KL divergence with its two arguments swapped. The loss function of beta diffusion, expressed in terms of Bregman divergence, further supports the efficacy of KLUBs for optimization. Experimental results on both synthetic data and natural images demonstrate the unique capabilities of beta diffusion in generative modeling of range-bounded data and validate the effectiveness of KLUBs in optimizing diffusion models, thereby making them valuable additions to the family of diffusion-based generative models and the optimization techniques used to train them.","creator":"Mingyuan Zhou, Tianqi Chen, Zhendong Wang, Huangjie Zheng"},{"id":"2309.07915","slug":"mmicl-empowering-vision-language-model-with-multi-modal-in-context-learning-arxiv-2309-07915v1-cs-cl","title":"MMICL: Empowering Vision-language Model with Multi-Modal In-Context Learning.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07915","abstract":"Starting from the resurgence of deep learning, vision-language models (VLMs) benefiting from large language models (LLMs) have never been so popular. However, while LLMs can utilize extensive background knowledge and task information with in-context learning, most VLMs still struggle with understanding complex multi-modal prompts with multiple images. The issue can traced back to the architectural design of VLMs or pre-training data. Specifically, the current VLMs primarily emphasize utilizing multi-modal data with a single image some, rather than multi-modal prompts with interleaved multiple images and text. Even though some newly proposed VLMs could handle user prompts with multiple images, pre-training data does not provide more sophisticated multi-modal prompts than interleaved image and text crawled from the web. We propose MMICL to address the issue by considering both the model and data perspectives. We introduce a well-designed architecture capable of seamlessly integrating visual and textual context in an interleaved manner and MIC dataset to reduce the gap between the training data and the complex user prompts in real-world applications, including: 1) multi-modal context with interleaved images and text, 2) textual references for each image, and 3) multi-image data with spatial, logical, or temporal relationships. Our experiments confirm that MMICL achieves new stat-of-the-art zero-shot and few-shot performance on a wide range of general vision-language tasks, especially for complex reasoning benchmarks including MME and MMBench. Our analysis demonstrates that MMICL effectively deals with the challenge of complex multi-modal prompt understanding.

For instance, medical institutions often use electrodes attached to different parts of a patient to analyse the electorencephal data rich with spatial and temporal features for health assessment and disease diagnosis. Existing research has mainly used deep learning techniques such as convolutional neural network (CNN) or recurrent neural network (RNN) to extract hidden spatial-temporal features. Yet, it is challenging to incorporate both inter-dependencies spatial information and dynamic temporal changes simultaneously. In reality, for a model that leverages these spatial-temporal features to fulfil complex prediction tasks, it often requires a colossal amount of training data in order to obtain satisfactory model performance.

Recently, offline RL becomes a popular RL paradigm because it saves the interactions with environments. In offline RL, data providers share large pre-collected datasets, and others can train high-quality agents without interacting with the environments. This paradigm has demonstrated effectiveness in critical tasks like robot control, autonomous driving, etc. However, less attention is paid to investigating the security threats to the offline RL system. This paper focuses on backdoor attacks, where some perturbations are added to the data (observations) such that given normal observations, the agent takes high-rewards actions, and low-reward actions on observations injected with triggers. In this paper, we propose Baffle (Backdoor Attack for Offline Reinforcement Learning), an approach that automatically implants backdoors to RL agents by poisoning the offline RL dataset, and evaluate how different offline RL algorithms react to this attack. Our experiments conducted on four tasks and four offline RL algorithms expose a disquieting fact: none of the existing offline RL algorithms is immune to such a backdoor attack. Baffle modifies $10\\%$ of the datasets for four tasks. Agents trained on the poisoned datasets perform well in normal settings. However, when triggers are presented, the agents' performance decreases drastically by $63.2\\%$, $53.9\\%$, $64.7\\%$, and $47.4\\%$ in the four tasks on average.

Here, we present a new RL algorithm that uses offline contrastive learning to hone in on critical steps. This algorithm, which we call contrastive introspection (ConSpec), can be added to any existing RL algorithm. ConSpec learns a set of prototypes for the critical steps in a task by a novel contrastive loss and delivers an intrinsic reward when the current state matches one of these prototypes. The prototypes in ConSpec provide two key benefits for credit assignment: (1) They enable rapid identification of all the critical steps. (2) They do so in a readily interpretable manner, enabling out-of-distribution generalization when sensory features are altered. Distinct from other contemporary RL approaches to credit assignment, ConSpec takes advantage of the fact that it is easier to retrospectively identify the small set of steps that success is contingent upon than it is to prospectively predict reward at every step taken in the environment. Altogether, ConSpec improves learning in a diverse set of RL tasks, including both those with explicit, discrete critical steps and those with complex, continuous critical steps.","creator":"Chen Sun, Wannan Yang, Thomas Jiralerspong, Dane Malenfant, Benjamin Alsbury-Nealy, Yoshua Bengio, Blake Richards"},{"id":"2210.16591","slug":"disenpoi-disentangling-sequential-and-geographical-influence-for-point-of-interest-recommendation-arxiv-2210-16591v2-cs-ir-updated","title":"DisenPOI: Disentangling Sequential and Geographical Influence for Point-of-Interest Recommendation.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.16591","abstract":"Point-of-Interest (POI) recommendation plays a vital role in various location-aware services.

The key novelty of our model compared with existing approaches is to extract disentangled representations of both sequential and geographical influences with contrastive learning. To be specific, we construct a geographical graph and a sequential graph based on the check-in sequence of a user. We tailor their propagation schemes to become sequence-/geo-aware to better capture the corresponding influences.

However, over a life, organisms will need to learn about many different aspects of the world's structure: the states of the world and state-vector transition dynamics. The number of combinations of states grows exponentially as an agent incorporates new knowledge, and there is no obvious weighted combination of pre-existing rewards or costs defined for a given combination of states, as such a weighting would need to encode information about good and bad combinations prior to an agent's experience in the world. Therefore, we must develop more naturalistic accounts of behavior and motivation in large state-spaces. We show that it is possible to use only the intrinsic motivation metric of empowerment, which measures the agent's capacity to realize many possible futures under a transition operator. We propose to scale empowerment to hierarchical state-spaces by using Operator Bellman Equations. These equations produce state-time feasibility functions, which are compositional hierarchical state-time transition operators that map an initial state and time when an agent begins a policy to the final states and times of completing a goal. Because these functions are hierarchical operators we can define hierarchical empowerment measures on them. An agent can then optimize plans to distant states and times to maximize its hierarchical empowerment-gain, allowing it to discover goals that bring about a more favorable coupling of its internal structure (physiological states) to its external environment (world structure &amp; spatial state). Life-long agents could therefore be primarily animated by principles of compositionality and empowerment, exhibiting self-concern for the growth &amp; maintenance of their own structural integrity without recourse to reward-maximization.","creator":"Thomas J.

State-of-the-art basecallers employ complex deep learning models to achieve high basecalling accuracy. This makes basecalling computationally-inefficient and memory-hungry; bottlenecking the entire genome analysis pipeline. However, for many applications, the majority of reads do no match the reference genome of interest (i.e., target reference) and thus are discarded in later steps in the genomics pipeline, wasting the basecalling computation. To overcome this issue, we propose TargetCall, the first pre-basecalling filter to eliminate the wasted computation in basecalling. TargetCall's key idea is to discard reads that will not match the target reference (i.e., off-target reads) prior to basecalling. TargetCall consists of two main components: (1) LightCall, a lightweight neural network basecaller that produces noisy reads; and (2) Similarity Check, which labels each of these noisy reads as on-target or off-target by matching them to the target reference. TargetCall aims to filter out all off-target reads before basecalling. The highly-accurate but slow basecalling is performed only on the raw signals whose noisy reads are labeled as on-target. Our thorough experimental evaluations using both real and simulated data show that TargetCall 1) improves the end-to-end basecalling performance while maintaining high sensitivity in keeping on-target reads, 2) maintains high accuracy in downstream analysis, 3) precisely filters out up to 94.71% of off-target reads, and 4) achieves better performance, throughput, sensitivity, precision, and generality compared to prior works.

[Nature Communications https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-023-36363-w (2023)], the authors present a deep reinforced learning approach to augment combinatorial optimization heuristics. In particular, they present results for several spin glass ground state problems, for which instances on non-planar networks are generally NP-hard, in comparison with several Monte Carlo based methods, such as simulated annealing (SA) or parallel tempering (PT). Indeed, those results demonstrate that the reinforced learning improves the results over those obtained with SA or PT, or at least allows for reduced runtimes for the heuristics before results of comparable quality have been obtained relative to those other methods. To facilitate the conclusion that their method is ''superior'', the authors pursue two basic strategies: (1) A commercial GUROBI solver is called on to procure a sample of exact ground states as a testbed to compare with, and (2) a head-to-head comparison between the heuristics is given for a sample of larger instances where exact ground states are hard to ascertain. Here, we put these studies into a larger context, showing that the claimed superiority is at best marginal for smaller samples and becomes essentially irrelevant with respect to any sensible approximation of true ground states in the larger samples. For example, this method becomes irrelevant as a means to determine stiffness exponents $\\theta$ in $d&gt;2$, as mentioned by the authors, where the problem is not only NP-hard but requires the subtraction of two almost equal ground-state energies and systemic errors in each of $\\approx 1\\%$ found here are unacceptable.

In this paper, we categorize languages as either unambiguous or {\\epsilon}-ambiguous and present quantitative results to demonstrate that the emergent abilities of LLMs, such as language understanding, in-context learning, chain-of-thought prompting, and effective instruction fine-tuning, can all be attributed to Bayesian inference on the sparse joint distribution of languages.","creator":"Hui Jiang"},{"id":"2304.10520","slug":"contrastive-tuning-a-little-help-to-make-masked-autoencoders-forget-arxiv-2304-10520v2-cs-cv-updated","title":"Contrastive Tuning: A Little Help to Make Masked Autoencoders Forget.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.10520","abstract":"Masked Image Modeling (MIM) methods, like Masked Autoencoders (MAE), efficiently learn a rich representation of the input.

In this work, we study how to combine the efficiency and scalability of MIM with the ability of ID to perform downstream classification in the absence of large amounts of labeled data. To this end, we introduce Masked Autoencoder Contrastive Tuning (MAE-CT), a sequential approach that utilizes the implicit clustering of the Nearest Neighbor Contrastive Learning (NNCLR) objective to induce abstraction in the topmost layers of a pre-trained MAE. MAE-CT tunes the rich features such that they form semantic clusters of objects without using any labels. Notably, MAE-CT does not rely on hand-crafted augmentations and frequently achieves its best performances while using only minimal augmentations (crop &amp; flip). Further, MAE-CT is compute efficient as it requires at most 10% overhead compared to MAE re-training. Applied to large and huge Vision Transformer (ViT) models, MAE-CT excels over previous self-supervised methods trained on ImageNet in linear probing, k-NN and low-shot classification accuracy as well as in unsupervised clustering accuracy.

In typical implementations of an SNN classifier, decisions are produced after the entire input sequence has been processed, resulting in latency and energy consumption levels that are fairly uniform across inputs. Recently introduced delay-adaptive SNNs tailor the inference latency -- and, with it, the energy consumption -- to the difficulty of each example, by producing an early decision when the SNN model is sufficiently ``confident''. In this paper, we start by observing that, as an SNN processes input samples, its classification decisions tend to be first under-confident and then over-confident with respect to the decision's ground-truth, unknown, test accuracy. This makes it difficult to determine a stopping time that ensures a desired level of accuracy. To address this problem, we introduce a novel delay-adaptive SNN-based inference methodology that, wrapping around any pre-trained SNN classifier, provides guaranteed reliability for the decisions produced at input-dependent stopping times. The approach entails minimal added complexity as compared to the underlying SNN, requiring only thresholding and counting operations at run time, and it leverages tools from conformal prediction (CP).","creator":"Jiechen Chen, Sangwoo Park, Osvaldo Simeone"},{"id":"2305.15021","slug":"embodiedgpt-vision-language-pre-training-via-embodied-chain-of-thought-arxiv-2305-15021v2-cs-ro-updated","title":"EmbodiedGPT: Vision-Language Pre-Training via Embodied Chain of Thought.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.15021","abstract":"Embodied AI is a crucial frontier in robotics, capable of planning and executing action sequences for robots to accomplish long-horizon tasks in physical environments.

We conduct comprehensive experiments to investigate the hallucination of LMMs. Our results demonstrate that existing LMMs exhibit significant hallucination when presented with our negative instructions, particularly with Existent Element Manipulation instructions.

Specifically, common data augmentation techniques frequently introduce semantic distortion, leading to a semantic margin between the positive pair. While the InfoNCE loss function overlooks the semantic margin and prioritizes similarity maximization between positive pairs during training, leading to the insensitive semantic comprehension ability of the trained model.

The proposed method uses reinforcement learning (RL) to initially track and imitate life-like movements from unstructured motion clips using the discrete information bottleneck, as adopted in the Vector Quantized Variational AutoEncoder (VQ-VAE). This structure compresses the most relevant information from the motion clips into a compact yet informative latent space, i.e., a discrete space over vector quantized codes. By sampling codes in the space from a trained categorical prior distribution, high-quality life-like behaviors can be generated, similar to the usage of VQ-VAE in computer vision. Although this prior distribution can be trained with the supervision of the encoder's output, it follows the original motion clip distribution in the dataset and could lead to imbalanced behaviors in our setting. To address the issue, we further propose a technique named prior shifting to adjust the prior distribution using curiosity-driven RL. The outcome distribution is demonstrated to offer sufficient behavioral diversity and significantly facilitates upper-level policy learning for downstream tasks. We conduct comprehensive experiments using humanoid characters on two challenging downstream tasks, sword-shield striking and two-player boxing game.

Consequently, these models are now well-positioned to reason about the physical world, particularly within domains such as robotic manipulation. However, current VLMs are limited in their understanding of the physical concepts (e.g., material, fragility) of common objects, which restricts their usefulness for robotic manipulation tasks that involve interaction and physical reasoning about such objects. To address this limitation, we propose PhysObjects, an object-centric dataset of 39.6K crowd-sourced and 417K automated physical concept annotations of common household objects. We demonstrate that fine-tuning a VLM on PhysObjects improves its understanding of physical object concepts, including generalization to held-out concepts, by capturing human priors of these concepts from visual appearance. We incorporate this physically-grounded VLM in an interactive framework with a large language model-based robotic planner, and show improved planning performance on tasks that require reasoning about physical object concepts, compared to baselines that do not leverage physically-grounded VLMs. We additionally illustrate the benefits of our physically-grounded VLM on a real robot, where it improves task success rates.

To accurately model user representations over time, recent studies in sequential recommendation utilize information propagation and evolution to mine from batches of arriving interactions. However, they ignore the fact that people are easily influenced by the recent actions of other users in the contextual scenario, and applying evolution across all historical interactions dilutes the importance of recent ones, thus failing to model the evolution of dynamic interest accurately. To address this issue, we propose a Context-Aware Pseudo-Multi-Task Recommender System (CPMR) to model the evolution in both historical and contextual scenarios by creating three representations for each user and item under different dynamics: static embedding, historical temporal states, and contextual temporal states. To dually improve the performance of temporal states evolution and incremental recommendation, we design a Pseudo-Multi-Task Learning (PMTL) paradigm by stacking the incremental single-target recommendations into one multi-target task for joint optimization. Within the PMTL paradigm, CPMR employs a shared-bottom network to conduct the evolution of temporal states across historical and contextual scenarios, as well as the fusion of them at the user-item level. In addition, CPMR incorporates one real tower for incremental predictions, and two pseudo towers dedicated to updating the respective temporal states based on new batches of interactions. Experimental results on four benchmark recommendation datasets show that CPMR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines and achieves significant gains on three of them.

Recently, various studies have achieved promising results. However, most studies assume the prediction locations have complete or at least partial historical records and cannot be extended to non-historical recorded locations. In real-life scenarios, the deployment of sensors could be limited due to budget limitations and installation availability, which makes most current models not applicable. Though few pieces of literature tried to impute traffic states at the missing locations, these methods need the data simultaneously observed at the locations with sensors, making them not applicable to prediction tasks. Another drawback is the lack of measurement of uncertainty in prediction, making prior works unsuitable for risk-sensitive tasks or involving decision-making. To fill the gap, inspired by the previous inductive graph neural network, this work proposed an uncertainty-aware framework with the ability to 1) extend prediction to missing locations with no historical records and significantly extend spatial coverage of prediction locations while reducing deployment of sensors and 2) generate probabilistic prediction with uncertainty quantification to help the management of risk and decision making in the down-stream tasks. Through extensive experiments on real-life datasets, the result shows our method achieved promising results on prediction tasks, and the uncertainty quantification gives consistent results which highly correlated with the locations with and without historical data.

In-depth analysis of the leaf lipid accumulation and 14CO2 metabolic tracing mechanistically described metabolic adaptations to the leaf oil engineering. An oil-for-membrane lipid tradeoff in the 15% oil line (referred to as HO) was surprisingly not further exacerbated when lipid production was enhanced to 30% (LEC2 line). The HO line exhibited a futile cycle that limited TAG yield through exchange with starch, altered carbon flux into various metabolite pools and end products, and suggested overlapping pathways of the glyoxylate cycle and photorespiration that limited CO2 assimilation by 50%. In contrast, inclusion of the LEC2 transcription factor in tobacco improved TAG stability, alleviated the TAG-to-starch futile cycle, and recovered CO2 assimilation and plant growth comparable to wild type but with much higher lipid levels in the leaves. Thus, the unstable production of storage reserves and futile cycling limit vegetative oil engineering approaches. The capacity to overcome futile cycles and maintain enhanced stable TAG levels in LEC2 demonstrated the importance of considering unanticipated metabolic adaptations while engineering vegetative oil crops.","creator":"Johnson, B.

For example, sudden exposure to high light leads to excess absorbed light energy, causing reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation. ROS damage the photosynthetic machinery, particularly the D1 protein in photosystem II (PSII), which therefore needs to be continuously repaired and replaced. The effect of the damage inflicted by high light is a prolonged decrease in photosynthetic efficiency. Hence, it is not surprising that photoinhibition has been subject to numerous experimental studies investigating its effects in the context of crop productivity. However, it has become apparent that classical measures of photoinhibition, i.e., changes in the chlorophyll fluorescence parameter Fv/Fm, are not only determined by the loss of PSII core function but also by processes such as energy transfer and quenching. Mathematical models can help dissect the influences on such fluorescence signals and quantify the contributions of various interacting mechanisms. We present a mathematical model with a dynamic description of the photosynthetic electron transport chain (PETC), non-photochemical quenching, and photoinhibition. With our model, we investigate the interconnection between quenching, photoprotection, and fluorescence using simulations and experimental data. We found that different energy-dissipating properties of intact and damaged PSIIs, as well as energy transfer between PSIIs, are critical components that need to be included in the model to ensure a satisfactory fit to the experimental data.

This approach is prone to deliver biased results due to inappropriate sampling of the regions of interest in the Z-direction, as the actual 3D distribution of autophagosomes is usually not taken into account. To overcome such drawbacks, we have developed and tested a workflow consisting of immunofluorescence microscopy of autophagosomes labelled with anti-ATG8 antibody followed by stereological image analysis employing the optical disector and the Cavalieri principle. Our immunolabelling protocol specifically recognized autophagosomes in epidermal cells of A. thaliana root. Higher numbers of immunolabelled autophagosomes were observed when compared with those recognized with FT-AtATG8e marker, suggesting that single AtATG8 isoform markers cannot detect all autophagosomes in a cell. Therefore, immunolabelling provides more precise information as the anti-ATG8 antibody recognizes virtually all AtATG8 isoforms.

Compared to autophagosome quantifications in maximum intensity projections, stereological methods detected autophagosomes present in a given volume with higher accuracy.

Herein, we examined the role of carotenoid as a source of apocarotenoids, which control endogenous auxin levels and plant root architecture. Inhibiting {beta}-carotene biosynthesis by phytoene desaturase (PDS) inhibitor fluridone suppresses root growth, consequently inducing lateral root growth. PDS was confirmed to be the target of fluridone via the expression of the fluridone-insensitive trait 35S::mHvPDS in an Arabidopsis plant. Inhibiting {beta}-carotene biosynthesis elevated endogenous auxin levels and activated auxin signaling, thereby suppressing root growth. In addition, the root growth of the auxin-deficient mutant yucQ was partially restored via fluridone treatment. These results indicate that suppressing PDS activity increases endogenous auxin levels and suppresses root growth. Conversely, the carotenoid pool indirectly suppresses endogenous auxin levels. Exogenous application of retinal, apocarotenoid derived from {beta}-carotene, complemented fluridone-mediated root growth inhibition and partially recovered auxin-mediated growth inhibition. Moreover, retinal inhibited the induction of the auxin-inducible reporter pIAA19::ElucPEST, indicating an antagonistic effect of retinal on endogenous auxin levels. Interestingly, the auxin-deficient mutants wei2 wei7 and yucQ accumulated more {beta}-carotene compared with the wild type. The expression of CCDs, which converts {beta}-carotene into apocarotenoids, is auxin-inducible and increases following fluridone treatment.

In angiosperms, one central cell and one egg cell are differentiated in the embryo sac as female gametes for double fertilization, while in non-flowering plants, only one egg cell is generated in the female sexual organ, called the archegonium. The central cell specification of Arabidopsis thaliana is controlled by the histidine kinase CYTOKININ-INDEPENDENT 1 (CKI1), which is a two-component signaling (TCS) activator sharing downstream regulatory components with the cytokinin signaling pathway. Our phylogenetic analysis suggested that CKI1 orthologs broadly exist in land plants. However, the role of CKI1 in the archegonium-bearing non-flowering plants remains unclear. Here we found that the sole CKI1 ortholog in the liverwort Marchantia polymorpha, MpCKI1, which functions through conserved downstream TCS components, regulates the female germline specification for egg cell development in the archegonium. In M. polymorpha, the archegonium develops three-dimensionally from a single cell, accumulating MpBONOBO (MpBNB), a master regulator for germline initiation and differentiation. We visualized female germline specification by capturing the distribution pattern of MpBNB in the discrete stages of early archegonium development, and found that the MpBNB accumulation is restricted to female germline cells. MpCKI1 is required for the proper MpBNB accumulation in the female germline, and is critical for the asymmetric cell divisions that specify the female germline cells. These results suggest that CKI1-mediated TCS originated during early land plant evolution and participates in female germ cell specification in deeply-diverged plant lineages.","creator":"Bao, H., Sun, R., Iwano, M., Yoshitake, Y., Aki, S.

OBJECTIVE: This study explores the idea that adaptation to these stresses could be increased by sowing summer crops early in late winter or spring, to avoid the overlap with critical crop stages around flowering. Here we report on the impacts of early sowing i.e., in late winter and spring on sorghum crop and root growth and function (i.e., water use), and final grain yield. METHODS: Two seasons of on-farm genotype (G) by environment (E) by management (M) sorghum experimentation were conducted in the Darling Downs region of Queensland, Australia. Each trial consisted of a factorial combination of three times of sowing (TOS, referred to as late winter, spring, and summer), two levels of irrigation, four target plant populations, and six commercial genotypes. Treatments were replicated three times. Crop roots and shoot were sampled at the flag leaf stage for each TOS. Crop water use across the growing season was monitored using time-lapse electromagnetic induction (EMI) surveys. EMI was also used to calculate a root activity factor. Final grain yield and yield components were determined at maturity. RESULTS: Results showed that TOS, irrigation levels, and their interactions significantly influenced crop root and shoot traits, water use, and yield, though results were not always consistent across seasons. In the first season which was dry and had large temperature contrasts between TOS, crop growth in the early sown crops was primarily limited by temperature. In contrast, the second season was much warmer and crop growth was instead primarily limited by water availability. Cold air and soil temperatures in the early sowing dates during the first season i.e., late winter and spring, lead to smaller crops with smaller rooting systems and root-to-shoot ratios, and roots having a larger average root diameter. In general terms, root length growth and root length density responded positively to increasing pre-flowering mean air temperatures ranging between 16 and 20C, while root average diameters were larger below 19 or above 21C. Early sowing advanced flowering and therefore decreased the risk of extreme heat during the critical stages around flowering and affected water use before and after flowering. The root activity factor was directly related to the crop root length density. The early sown crops increased yield by transferring water use from vegetative to reproductive stages. The larger yield of early sown sorghum was associated with larger grain numbers. Early sown crops had larger values of water use efficiency associated with larger total grain numbers, particularly for the tillers. As expected, the lowest values of water use efficiency were observed in irrigated and summer sown crops. The early sowing times left more water in the soil profile at maturity, particularly under irrigated conditions and with small plant populations. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that early sown sorghum is a potential option to increase crop adaptation to hotter and drier environments. Here we propose that in the race to increase crop adaptation to heat stresses, plant breeding efforts should consider cold tolerance traits during crop germination, emergence, and early vegetative stages so that sorghum sowing windows could be significantly advanced.","creator":"Zhao, D., deVoil, P., G.

We identified 14,766 differentially expressed genes, of which 4369 genes showed alternative splicing. We observed that genes mapped to the plastid-localized methyl-erythritol-phosphate (MEP) pathway were upregulated in light compared to the cytosolic mevalonate (MVA) pathway genes. Many of these genes also undergo splicing. These pathways provide crucial metabolite precursors for the biosynthesis of secondary metabolic compounds needed for chloroplast biogenesis, the establishment of successful photosynthetic apparatus, and photomorphogenesis. In the chromosome-wide survey of the light-induced transcriptome, we observed intron retention as the most predominant splicing event.

In this study, Westar was identified to outperform than ZS11 under salt stress. Through cell component isolation, non-invasive micro-test, X-ray energy spectrum analysis, and ionomic profiling characterization, pectin demethylation was found to be a major regulator for differential salt resistance between Westar and ZS11. Integrated analyses of genome-wide DNA variations, differentially expression profiling, and gene co-expression network identified BnaC9.PME47, encoding pectin methyl esterase, as a positive regulator mainly responsible for salt stress resistance. BnaC9.PME47, located in two reported QTLs regions for salt resistance, was strongly induced by salt stress and localized on the cell wall. Natural variation of the promoter regions conferred higher expression of BnaC9.PME47 in Westar than in other salt-sensitive rapeseed genotypes. Loss-of-function of AtPME47 resulted in the hypersensitivity of Arabidopsis plants to salt stress. This study facilitates a more comprehensive understanding of the differential morpho-physiological and molecular responses to salt stress and abundant genetic diversity in rapeseed genotypes, and the integrated multiomics analyses provide novel insights regarding the rapid dissection of quantitative trait genes responsible for nutrient stresses in plant species with complex genomes.","creator":"Zhou, T., Wu, P.-j., Chen, J.-f., Du, X.-q., Feng, Y.-n., Yue, C.-p., Huang, J.-y., Hua, Y.-p."},{"id":"2023.09.09.556968v1","slug":"comparison-of-the-microbiome-and-mycobiome-in-tissues-of-the-tropical-carnivorous-epiphytic-herb-utricularia-jamesoniana","title":"Comparison of the microbiome and mycobiome in tissues of the tropical carnivorous epiphytic herb Utricularia jamesoniana","link":"http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2023.09.09.556968v1?rss=1","abstract":"Utricularia jamesoniana, a small epiphytic plant found in wet tropical forests, stands out for its carnivorous habit, intricate trap system, and small but beautiful and complex flowers.

Rhizobia are housed in lateral root-derived organs termed nodules that maintain an environment conducive to Nitrogenase in these bacteria. Several phytohormones are important for regulating the formation of nodules, with both positive and negative roles proposed for gibberellin (GA). In this study, we determined the cellular location and function of bioactive GA during nodule organogenesis using a genetically-encoded second generation GA biosensor, GPS2. We found endogenous bioactive GA accumulates locally at the site of nodule primordia, increasing dramatically in the cortical cell layers, persisting through cell divisions and maintaining accumulation in the mature nodule meristem. We show, through mis-expression of GA catabolic enzymes that suppress GA accumulation, that GA acts as a positive regulator of nodule growth and development. Furthermore, increasing or decreasing GA through perturbation of biosynthesis gene expression can increase or decrease the size of nodules, respectively. This is unique from lateral root formation, a developmental program that shares common organogenesis regulators. We link GA to a wider gene regulatory program by showing that cytokinin as well as nodule-identity genes induce and sustain GA accumulation necessary for nodule function.","creator":"Drapek, C., Radzman-Mohd, N.

We show that this balance is modulated epigenetically by DNA methylation and orchestrated by IBM2, a factor involved in the processing of intronic heterochromatin. The stress-sensitive allele of FLC has recently spread across populations subjected to recurrent chemical weeding, and we demonstrate that retrotransposon-driven acceleration of life cycle represents a rapid response to herbicide. Our findings illustrate how retrotransposition can create environmentally-sensitive alleles that facilitate adaptation to anthropogenic disturbances of the environment.","creator":"Raingeval, M., Leduque, B., Baduel, P., Edera, A., Roux, F., Colot, V., Quadrana, L."},{"id":"2023.09.04.556251v1","slug":"identifying-the-fungal-diseases-of-african-yam-bean-sphenostylis-stenocarpa-harms-and-their-occurrence-in-south-west-nigeria","title":"Identifying the fungal diseases of African Yam Bean (\tSphenostylis stenocarpa   Harms) and their occurrence in South- West Nigeria","link":"http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2023.09.04.556251v1?rss=1","abstract":"Sphenostylis stenocarpa, commonly known as African yam bean (AYB), is an orphan crop with high nutritional properties but low yield production due to diseases. Hence, this study accessed the diversity and pathogenicity of fungi associated with AYB in Southwest (SW) Nigeria as a model area of cultivation. The incidence of fungi infecting AYB were surveyed in Oyo, Ondo, Ekiti, Osun, and Ogun states within SW Nigeria during 2018 planting season. The common field symptoms across all sites were tiny spot, brown spot, leaf blight, brown spot with yellow halo, necrotic lesion, and brown spot on pods. A total of 1005 fungi were isolated from leaf and pod samples, and identified morphologically on pure cultures as Aspergillus sp, Botrytis sp, Colletotrichum gloeosporioides, Curvularia lunata, Trichoderma harzianum, Macrophomina phaseolina, Pestalotia sp, Phoma sp, Fusarium verticillioides, F. oxysporum, F. solani, Botryodiplodia theobromae, and Choanephora curcubitarium and Nigrospora spp. Phoma sp and C. gleosporoides had highest frequency of occurrence 69.9% and 51.9% at early and mature stages, respectively. To conform to Kochs postulates, the pathogenicities of 12 exemplar strains of the most abundant fungal species were confirmed in controlled glasshouse tests. The identities of Colletotrichum sp., Aspergillus sp., Didymella sp., Pestalopsis sp, Lasiodiplodia theobromae, F. solani and F. oxysporum were confirmed based on internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequencing and comparisons with the Genbank database. AYB germplasm from curated seed banks and farmer donated landraces were grown at the same site in 2020 and identical fungi were isolated. Further, genotypes with reduced disease incidences and incidences were identified. This first study to reveal the diversity of fungi associated with AYB in SW Nigeria that could inform disease management practices.","creator":"Oyedele, T., Kehinde, I., Atanda, H.

The precise mechanisms underlying transmission of functions of these associations are often difficult to describe, due to the difficulty in separating the symbiotic partners. This is especially the case for plant-bacteria hereditary symbioses, which lack experimentally tractable model systems. Here, we demonstrate the potential of the leaf symbiosis between the wild yam Dioscorea sansibarensis and the bacterium Orrella dioscoreae (O. dioscoreae) as a model system for hereditary symbiosis. O. dioscoreae is easy to grow and genetically manipulate, which is unusual for hereditary symbionts. These properties allowed us to design an effective antimicrobial treatment to rid plants of bacteria and generate whole aposymbiotic plants, which can later be re-inoculated with bacterial cultures. Aposymbiotic plants did not differ morphologically from symbiotic plants and the leaf forerunner tip containing the symbiotic glands formed normally even in the absence of bacteria, but microscopic differences between symbiotic and aposymbiotic glands highlight the influence of bacteria on the development of trichomes and secretion of mucilage. This is to our knowledge the first leaf symbiosis where both host and symbiont can be grown separately and where the symbiont can be genetically altered and reintroduced to the host.","creator":"Acar, T., Moreau, S., Jardinaud, M.-F., Houdinet, G., Maviane-Macia, F., De Meyer, F., Hoste, B., Leroux, O., Coen, O., Le Ru, A., Peeters, N., Carlier, A."},{"id":"2023.09.01.555968v1","slug":"a-congestion-downstream-of-psi-causes-the-over-reduction-of-the-electron-transport-chain-in-pgr5-independent-of-membrane-energization","title":"A congestion downstream of PSI causes the over-reduction of the electron transport chain in pgr5 independent of membrane energization","link":"http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2023.09.01.555968v1?rss=1","abstract":"The thylakoid protein Proton Gradient Regulation5 (PGR5) is thought to be a key component of cyclic electron flux around photosystem I. The pgr5 mutant is characterized by impaired proton motive force (pmf) formation across the thylakoid membrane, decreased photoprotective non-photochemical quenching (NPQ), and an over-reduction of the PSI acceptor side. This over-reduction has been attributed to impaired photosynthetic control, which down-regulates plastoquinol re-oxidation at the cytochrome b6f complex when the lumen is strongly acidified. Here, using the cgl160 ATP synthase assembly mutant, we show that in cgl160 pgr5 double mutants, both the pmf across the thylakoid membrane and NPQ are fully restored to wild-type levels. However, the acceptor-side limitation of PSI in the double mutants stays comparable to the single pgr5 mutant. This demonstrates that impaired photosynthetic control is not causal for the over-reduction of the PSI acceptor side in pgr5. Instead, we show that both in pgr5 and the clg160 pgr5 mutants, the entire high-potential chain from cytochrome f to PSI remains strongly reduced in high light. This leads to insufficient oxidizing power for plastoquinol re-oxidation by the cytochrome b6f complex, thus impairing pmf formation. We conclude that PGR5 plays a critical role in electron partitioning downstream of PSI.","creator":"Kappel, S., Thiele, W., Gefen-Treves, S., Henze, A., Armbruster, U., Schöttler, M.

Taking advantage of mutants showing temperature-dependent phenotypes we conducted a comprehensive study of the role that the methylosome and SMN complexes have in plant snRNP assembly. Genetic analyses, as well as in vivo and in vitro evidence suggest a mechanism for snRNP assembly in plants that differs remarkably from vertebrate animals. The SMN complex in plants is apparently reduced to a single protein, GEMIN2, that is not essential for plant development. Similarly, the methylosome has a less crucial role in spliceosome assembly than previously thought.

We show that, without transfers, only trivial social choice rules can be implemented in a prior-independent way. We obtain a tight bound on the decision error that results when the quota does not match the true type distribution.

Using U.S. historical data, I show that when servicing the debt creates a fiscal burden, the government responds to spending shocks by limiting debt issuance. As a result, the initial shock triggers only a limited increase in public spending in the short run, and even leads to spending reversal in the long run. Under these conditions, fiscal policy loses its ability to stimulate economic activity. This outcome arises as the fiscal authority limits its own ability to borrow to ensure public debt sustainability. These findings are robust to several identification and estimation strategies.","creator":"Venance Riblier"},{"id":"2309.07427","slug":"measuring-higher-order-rationality-with-belief-control-arxiv-2309-07427v1-econ-gn","title":"Measuring Higher-Order Rationality with Belief Control.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07427","abstract":"Determining an individual's strategic reasoning capability based solely on choice data is a complex task.

This use of robot players allows us to disentangle limited reasoning capacity from belief formation and social biases. Our results show that, when paired with robots, subjects consistently demonstrate higher levels of rationality and maintain stable rationality levels across different games compared to when paired with humans. This suggests that strategic reasoning might indeed be a consistent trait in individuals. Furthermore, the identified rationality limits could serve as a measure for evaluating an individual's strategic capacity when their beliefs about others are adequately controlled.","creator":"Wei James Chen, Meng-Jhang Fong, Po-Hsuan Lin"},{"id":"2309.07476","slug":"causal-inference-in-network-experiments-regression-based-analysis-and-design-based-properties-arxiv-2309-07476v1-econ-em","title":"Causal inference in network experiments: regression-based analysis and design-based properties.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07476","abstract":"Network experiments have been widely used in investigating interference among units. Under the ``approximate neighborhood interference\" framework introduced by \\cite{Leung2022}, treatments assigned to individuals farther from the focal individual result in a diminished effect on the focal individual's response, while the effect remains potentially nonzero. \\cite{Leung2022} establishes the consistency and asymptotic normality of the inverse-probability weighting estimator for estimating causal effects in the presence of interference. We extend these asymptotic results to the Hajek estimator which is numerically identical to the coefficient from the weighted-least-squares fit based on the inverse probability of the exposure mapping. The numerically equivalent regression-based approach offers two notable advantages: it can provide standard error estimators through the same weighted-least-squares fit, and it allows for the integration of covariates into the analysis. Furthermore, we introduce the regerssion-based network-robust variance estimator, adopting the form of the Heteroskedasticity and Autocorrelation Consistent estimator, and analyze its asymptotic bias. Recognizing that the variance estimator can be anti-conservative, we propose an adjusted variance estimator to improve empirical coverage.

Using a correspondence audit approach, I simulated a CV screening task in which I instructed the chatbot to rate fictitious applicant profiles only differing in names, signalling ethnic and gender identity. Comparing ratings of Arab, Asian, Black American, Central African, Dutch, Eastern European, Hispanic, Turkish, and White American male and female applicants, I show that ethnic and gender identity influence ChatGPT's evaluations. The ethnic bias appears to arise partly from the prompts' language and partly from ethnic identity cues in applicants' names. Although ChatGPT produces no overall gender bias, I find some evidence for a gender-ethnicity interaction effect.
