In this paper, we propose SocialFormer, an agent interaction-aware trajectory prediction method that leverages the semantic relationship between the target vehicle and surrounding vehicles by making use of the road topology. We also introduce an edge-enhanced heterogeneous graph transformer (EHGT) as the aggregator in a graph neural network (GNN) to encode the semantic and spatial agent interaction information. Additionally, we introduce a temporal encoder based on gated recurrent units (GRU) to model the temporal social behavior of agent movements. Finally, we present an information fusion framework that integrates agent encoding, lane encoding, and agent interaction encoding for a holistic representation of the traffic scene. We evaluate SocialFormer for the trajectory prediction task on the popular nuScenes benchmark and achieve state-of-the-art performance.","creator":"Zixu Wang, Zhigang Sun, Juergen Luettin, Lavdim Halilaj"},{"id":"2405.03825","slug":"organizing-a-society-of-language-models-structures-and-mechanisms-for-enhanced-collective-intelligence","title":"Organizing a Society of Language Models: Structures and Mechanisms for Enhanced Collective Intelligence","link":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03825","abstract":"Abstract: Recent developments in Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly expanded their applications across various domains.

However, the efficacy of these decisions hinges on the quality of the underlying data. Poor data quality can result in inaccurate analyses and deceptive conclusions. Managing the vast volume, velocity, and variety of data sources presents significant challenges, heightening the importance of addressing big data quality issues. While there has been increased attention from both academia and industry, current approaches often lack comprehensiveness and universality. They tend to focus on limited metrics, neglecting other dimensions of data quality. Moreover, existing methods are often context-specific, limiting their applicability across different domains. There is a clear need for intelligent, automated approaches leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) for advanced data quality corrections.   To bridge these gaps, this Ph.D. thesis proposes a novel set of interconnected frameworks aimed at enhancing big data quality comprehensively. Firstly, we introduce new quality metrics and a weighted scoring system for precise data quality assessment. Secondly, we present a generic framework for detecting various quality anomalies using AI models. Thirdly, we propose an innovative framework for correcting detected anomalies through predictive modeling. Additionally, we address metadata quality enhancement within big data ecosystems. These frameworks are rigorously tested on diverse datasets, demonstrating their efficacy in improving big data quality.

Onsets of the yellow lights prompt varied responses from different drivers: some may brake abruptly, compromising the ride comfort, while others may accelerate, increasing the risk of red-light violations and potential safety hazards. Such diversity in drivers' stop-or-go decisions may result from not only surrounding traffic conditions, but also personalized driving behaviors. To this end, identifying personalized driving behaviors and integrating them into advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) to mitigate the dilemma zone problem presents an intriguing scientific question. In this study, we employ a game engine-based (i.e., CARLA-enabled) driving simulator to collect high-resolution vehicle trajectories, incoming traffic signal phase and timing information, and stop-or-go decisions from four subject drivers in various scenarios. This approach allows us to analyze personalized driving behaviors in dilemma zones and develop a Personalized Transformer Encoder to predict individual drivers' stop-or-go decisions. The results show that the Personalized Transformer Encoder improves the accuracy of predicting driver decision-making in the dilemma zone by 3.7% to 12.6% compared to the Generic Transformer Encoder, and by 16.8% to 21.6% over the binary logistic regression model.","creator":"Ziye Qin, Siyan Li, Guoyuan Wu, Matthew J.

This process, also referred to as sequential experimentation, faces challenges due to the vast search space, the rarity of target molecules, and constraints imposed by limited data and experimental budgets. To address these challenges, we introduce a human-in-the-loop framework for sequential experiments in drug discovery. This collaborative approach combines human expert knowledge with deep learning algorithms, enhancing the discovery of target molecules within a specified experimental budget. The proposed algorithm processes experimental data to recommend both promising molecules and those that could improve its performance to human experts. Human experts retain the final decision-making authority based on these recommendations and their domain expertise, including the ability to override algorithmic recommendations. We applied our method to drug discovery tasks using real-world data and found that it consistently outperforms all baseline methods, including those which rely solely on human or algorithmic input. This demonstrates the complementarity between human experts and the algorithm.

Often they are viewed as state transformers with planning objectives defined with respect to paths over MDP states. An increasingly popular alternative is to view them as distribution transformers, giving rise to a sequence of probability distributions over MDP states. For instance, reachability and safety properties in modeling robot swarms or chemical reaction networks are naturally defined in terms of probability distributions over states. Verifying such distributional properties is known to be hard and often beyond the reach of classical state-based verification techniques.   In this work, we consider the problems of certified policy (i.e. controller) verification and synthesis in MDPs under distributional reach-avoidance specifications. By certified we mean that, along with a policy, we also aim to synthesize a (checkable) certificate ensuring that the MDP indeed satisfies the property. Thus, given the target set of distributions and an unsafe set of distributions over MDP states, our goal is to either synthesize a certificate for a given policy or synthesize a policy along with a certificate, proving that the target distribution can be reached while avoiding unsafe distributions. To solve this problem, we introduce the novel notion of distributional reach-avoid certificates and present automated procedures for (1) synthesizing a certificate for a given policy, and (2) synthesizing a policy together with the certificate, both providing formal guarantees on certificate correctness. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates the ability of our method to solve several non-trivial examples, including a multi-agent robot-swarm model, to synthesize certified policies and to certify existing policies.","creator":"S.

The system is based on a fine-tuned open-source transformer model which we trained on large set of exam data from university courses across a large range of disciplines. We evaluated the trained model's performance against held-out test data in a first experiment and found high accuracy levels across a broad spectrum of unseen questions, even in unseen courses. We further compared the performance of our model with that of certified human domain experts in a second experiment: we first assembled another test dataset from real historical exams - the historic grades contained in that data were awarded to students in a regulated, legally binding examination process; we therefore considered them as ground truth for our experiment. We then asked certified human domain experts and our model to grade the historic student answers again without disclosing the historic grades. Finally, we compared the hence obtained grades with the historic grades (our ground truth). We found that for the courses examined, the model deviated less from the official historic grades than the human re-graders - the model's median absolute error was 44 % smaller than the human re-graders', implying that the model is more consistent than humans in grading. These results suggest that leveraging AI enhanced grading can reduce human subjectivity, improve consistency and thus ultimately increase fairness.","creator":"Alexandra Gobrecht, Felix Tuma, Moritz M\\\"oller, Thomas Z\\\"oller, Mark Zakhvatkin, Alexandra Wuttig, Holger Sommerfeldt, Sven Sch\\\"utt"},{"id":"2405.04324","slug":"granite-code-models-a-family-of-open-foundation-models-for-code-intelligence","title":"Granite Code Models: A Family of Open Foundation Models for Code Intelligence","link":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04324","abstract":"Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) trained on code are revolutionizing the software development process.

Generative AI and large language model (LLM) applications are transforming how individuals find and access data and knowledge. However, the intricate relationship between open data and generative AI, and the vast potential it holds for driving innovation in this field remain underexplored areas. This white paper seeks to unpack the relationship between open data and generative AI and explore possible components of a new Fourth Wave of Open Data: Is open data becoming AI ready? Is open data moving towards a data commons approach? Is generative AI making open data more conversational? Will generative AI improve open data quality and provenance? Towards this end, we provide a new Spectrum of Scenarios framework. This framework outlines a range of scenarios in which open data and generative AI could intersect and what is required from a data quality and provenance perspective to make open data ready for those specific scenarios. These scenarios include: pertaining, adaptation, inference and insight generation, data augmentation, and open-ended exploration. Through this process, we found that in order for data holders to embrace generative AI to improve open data access and develop greater insights from open data, they first must make progress around five key areas: enhance transparency and documentation, uphold quality and integrity, promote interoperability and standards, improve accessibility and useability, and address ethical considerations.","creator":"Hannah Chafetz, Sampriti Saxena, Stefaan G.

Given a constant stream of time series sensory data from such systems, deep learning models have risen to prominence at identifying complex, nonlinear temporal dependencies in these data. In addition to the temporal dependencies of individual sensors, spatial dependencies emerge as important correlations among these sensors, which can be naturally modelled by a temporal graph that describes time-varying spatial relationships. However, the majority of existing studies have relied on capturing discrete snapshots of this temporal graph, a coarse-grained approach that leads to loss of temporal information. Moreover, given the variety of heterogeneous sensors, it becomes vital that such inherent heterogeneity is leveraged for RUL prediction in temporal sensor graphs. To capture the nuances of the temporal and spatial relationships and heterogeneous characteristics in an interconnected graph of sensors, we introduce a novel model named Temporal and Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks (THGNN). Specifically, THGNN aggregates historical data from neighboring nodes to accurately capture the temporal dynamics and spatial correlations within the stream of sensor data in a fine-grained manner. Moreover, the model leverages Feature-wise Linear Modulation (FiLM) to address the diversity of sensor types, significantly improving the model's capacity to learn the heterogeneity in the data sources. Finally, we have validated the effectiveness of our approach through comprehensive experiments. Our empirical findings demonstrate significant advancements on the N-CMAPSS dataset, achieving improvements of up to 19.2% and 31.6% in terms of two different evaluation metrics over state-of-the-art methods.","creator":"Zhihao Wen, Yuan Fang, Pengcheng Wei, Fayao Liu, Zhenghua Chen, Min Wu"},{"id":"2405.04344","slug":"enhancing-scalability-of-metric-differential-privacy-via-secret-dataset-partitioning-and-benders-decomposition","title":"Enhancing Scalability of Metric Differential Privacy via Secret Dataset Partitioning and Benders Decomposition","link":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04344","abstract":"Abstract: Metric Differential Privacy (mDP) extends the concept of Differential Privacy (DP) to serve as a new paradigm of data perturbation. It is designed to protect secret data represented in general metric space, such as text data encoded as word embeddings or geo-location data on the road network or grid maps. To derive an optimal data perturbation mechanism under mDP, a widely used method is linear programming (LP), which, however, might suffer from a polynomial explosion of decision variables, rendering it impractical in large-scale mDP.   In this paper, our objective is to develop a new computation framework to enhance the scalability of the LP-based mDP. Considering the connections established by the mDP constraints among the secret records, we partition the original secret dataset into various subsets. Building upon the partition, we reformulate the LP problem for mDP and solve it via Benders Decomposition, which is composed of two stages: (1) a master program to manage the perturbation calculation across subsets and (2) a set of subproblems, each managing the perturbation derivation within a subset. Our experimental results on multiple datasets, including geo-location data in the road network/grid maps, text data, and synthetic data, underscore our proposed mechanism's superior scalability and efficiency.","creator":"Chenxi Qiu"},{"id":"2405.04386","slug":"pragmatist-intelligence-where-the-principle-of-usefulness-can-take-anns","title":"Pragmatist Intelligence: Where the Principle of Usefulness Can Take ANNs","link":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04386","abstract":"Abstract: Artificial neural networks (ANNs) perform extraordinarily on numerous tasks including classification or prediction, e.g., speech processing and image classification.

Here, we review the connection between the model parameter selection in machine learning (ML) algorithms running on ANNs and the epistemological theory of neopragmatism focusing on the theory's utility and anti-representationalist aspects. To understand the consequences of the model parameter selection of an ANN, we suggest using neopragmatist theories whose implications are well studied. Incidentally, neopragmatism's notion of optimization is also based on utility considerations. This means that applying this approach elegantly reveals the inherent connections between optimization in ML, using a numerical method during the learning phase, and optimization in the ethical theory of consequentialism, where it occurs as a maxim of action. We suggest that these connections originate from the way relevance is calculated in ML systems.

This is done on a population level since the context that is capturing the subjective Point-Of-View (POV) of a concrete person in a specific situational context is not retained in the data. However, we argue that alignment on an individual level can boost the subjective predictive performance for the individual user interacting with the system considerably. Since perception differs for each person, the same situation is observed differently. Consequently, the basis for decision making and the subsequent reasoning processes and observable reactions differ. We hypothesize that individual perception patterns can be used for improving the alignment on an individual level. We test this, by integrating perception information into machine learning systems and measuring their predictive performance wrt.~individual subjective assessments. For our empirical study, we collect a novel data set of multimodal stimuli and corresponding eye tracking sequences for the novel task of Perception-Guided Crossmodal Entailment and tackle it with our Perception-Guided Multimodal Transformer. Our findings suggest that exploiting individual perception signals for the machine learning of subjective human assessments provides a valuable cue for individual alignment. It does not only improve the overall predictive performance from the point-of-view of the individual user but might also contribute to steering AI systems towards every person's individual expectations and values.","creator":"Simon Werner, Katharina Christ, Laura Bernardy, Marion G.

To address this issue, the continual knowledge graph embedding (CKGE) task has been proposed to train the KGE model by learning emerging knowledge efficiently while simultaneously preserving decent old knowledge. However, the explicit graph structure in KGs, which is critical for the above goal, has been heavily ignored by existing CKGE methods. On the one hand, existing methods usually learn new triples in a random order, destroying the inner structure of new KGs. On the other hand, old triples are preserved with equal priority, failing to alleviate catastrophic forgetting effectively. In this paper, we propose a competitive method for CKGE based on incremental distillation (IncDE), which considers the full use of the explicit graph structure in KGs. First, to optimize the learning order, we introduce a hierarchical strategy, ranking new triples for layer-by-layer learning. By employing the inter- and intra-hierarchical orders together, new triples are grouped into layers based on the graph structure features. Secondly, to preserve the old knowledge effectively, we devise a novel incremental distillation mechanism, which facilitates the seamless transfer of entity representations from the previous layer to the next one, promoting old knowledge preservation. Finally, we adopt a two-stage training paradigm to avoid the over-corruption of old knowledge influenced by under-trained new knowledge. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of IncDE over state-of-the-art baselines. Notably, the incremental distillation mechanism contributes to improvements of 0.2%-6.5% in the mean reciprocal rank (MRR) score.","creator":"Jiajun Liu, Wenjun Ke, Peng Wang, Ziyu Shang, Jinhua Gao, Guozheng Li, Ke Ji, Yanhe Liu"},{"id":"2405.04459","slug":"a-significantly-better-class-of-activation-functions-than-relu-like-activation-functions","title":"A Significantly Better Class of Activation Functions Than ReLU Like Activation Functions","link":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04459","abstract":"Abstract: This paper introduces a significantly better class of activation functions than the almost universally used ReLU like and Sigmoidal class of activation functions. Two new activation functions referred to as the Cone and Parabolic-Cone that differ drastically from popular activation functions and significantly outperform these on the CIFAR-10 and Imagenette benchmmarks are proposed. The cone activation functions are positive only on a finite interval and are strictly negative except at the end-points of the interval, where they become zero. Thus the set of inputs that produce a positive output for a neuron with cone activation functions is a hyperstrip and not a half-space as is the usual case. Since a hyper strip is the region between two parallel hyper-planes, it allows neurons to more finely divide the input feature space into positive and negative classes than with infinitely wide half-spaces. In particular the XOR function can be learn by a single neuron with cone-like activation functions. Both the cone and parabolic-cone activation functions are shown to achieve higher accuracies with significantly fewer neurons on benchmarks. The results presented in this paper indicate that many nonlinear real-world datasets may be separated with fewer hyperstrips than half-spaces. The Cone and Parabolic-Cone activation functions have larger derivatives than ReLU and are shown to significantly speedup training.","creator":"Mathew Mithra Noel, Yug Oswal"},{"id":"2405.04491","slug":"torchdriveenv-a-reinforcement-learning-benchmark-for-autonomous-driving-with-reactive-realistic-and-diverse-non-playable-characters","title":"TorchDriveEnv: A Reinforcement Learning Benchmark for Autonomous Driving with Reactive, Realistic, and Diverse Non-Playable Characters","link":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04491","abstract":"Abstract: The training, testing, and deployment, of autonomous vehicles requires realistic and efficient simulators.

Despite being of interest to the data management community for decades, the ultimate vision of end-to-end workflow automation has remained elusive. Current solutions rely on process mining and robotic process automation (RPA), in which a bot is hard-coded to follow a set of predefined rules for completing a workflow. Through case studies of a hospital and large B2B enterprise, we find that the adoption of RPA has been inhibited by high set-up costs (12-18 months), unreliable execution (60% initial accuracy), and burdensome maintenance (requiring multiple FTEs). Multimodal foundation models (FMs) such as GPT-4 offer a promising new approach for end-to-end workflow automation given their generalized reasoning and planning abilities.

In this paper, we consider the scenario where the escape flight vehicle (EFV) generates guidance commands based on DRL and the pursuit flight vehicle (PFV) generates guidance commands based on the proportional navigation method. For the EFV, the objective of the guidance design entails progressively maximizing the residual velocity, subject to the constraint imposed by the given evasion distance. Thus an irregular dynamic max-min problem of extremely large-scale is formulated, where the time instant when the optimal solution can be attained is uncertain and the optimum solution depends on all the intermediate guidance commands generated before. For solving this problem, a two-step strategy is conceived. In the first step, we use the proximal policy optimization (PPO) algorithm to generate the guidance commands of the EFV. The results obtained by PPO in the global search space are coarse, despite the fact that the reward function, the neural network parameters and the learning rate are designed elaborately. Therefore, in the second step, we propose to invoke the evolution strategy (ES) based algorithm, which uses the result of PPO as the initial value, to further improve the quality of the solution by searching in the local space. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed guidance design method based on the PPO algorithm is capable of achieving a residual velocity of 67.24 m/s, higher than the residual velocities achieved by the benchmark soft actor-critic and deep deterministic policy gradient algorithms.

We propose a network adversarial method to address the aforementioned challenges. This is the first method to use different activation functions in a network. Based on the existing activation functions in the current network, an adversarial function with opposite derivative image properties is constructed, and the two are alternately used as activation functions for different network layers. For complex situations, we propose a method of high-dimensional function graph decomposition(HD-FGD), which divides it into different parts and then passes through a linear layer. After integrating the inverse of the partial derivatives of each decomposed term, we obtain its adversarial function by referring to the computational rules of the decomposition process. The use of network adversarial methods or the use of HD-FGD alone can effectively replace the traditional MLP+activation function mode. Through the above methods, we have achieved a substantial improvement over standard activation functions regarding both training efficiency and predictive accuracy.

Desired characteristics for an AI agent can be expressed by assigning desirability scores, which we assume are not assigned to individual behaviors but to collective trajectories. For example, in a dataset of vehicle interactions, these scores might relate to the number of incidents that occurred. We first assess the effect of each individual agent's behavior on the collective desirability score, e.g., assessing how likely an agent is to cause incidents. This allows us to selectively imitate agents with a positive effect, e.g., only imitating agents that are unlikely to cause incidents. To enable this, we propose the concept of an agent's Exchange Value, which quantifies an individual agent's contribution to the collective desirability score.

Offline RL has emerged as an alternative solution, learning from pre-collected static datasets. However, this offline learning introduces a new challenge known as distributional shift, degrading the performance when the policy is evaluated on scenarios that are Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) from the training dataset. Most existing offline RL resolves this issue by regularizing policy learning within the information supported by the given dataset. However, such regularization overlooks the potential for high-reward regions that may exist beyond the dataset. This motivates exploring novel offline learning techniques that can make improvements beyond the data support without compromising policy performance, potentially by learning causation (cause-and-effect) instead of correlation from the dataset.

Recognizing the potential to extend this capability, we introduce Relating-Up, a plug-and-play module that enhances GNNs by exploiting inter-graph relationships. This module incorporates a relation-aware encoder and a feedback training strategy. The former enables GNNs to capture relationships across graphs, enriching relation-aware graph representation through collective context. The latter utilizes a feedback loop mechanism for the recursively refinement of these representations, leveraging insights from refining inter-graph dynamics to conduct feedback loop. The synergy between these two innovations results in a robust and versatile module. Relating-Up enhances the expressiveness of GNNs, enabling them to encapsulate a wider spectrum of graph relationships with greater precision.

TrimCaching exploits the key observation that a wide range of AI models, such as convolutional neural networks or large language models, can share a significant proportion of parameter blocks containing reusable knowledge, thereby improving storage efficiency. To this end, we formulate a parameter-sharing model placement problem to maximize the cache hit ratio in multi-edge wireless networks by balancing the fundamental tradeoff between storage efficiency and service latency.

To mitigate the latter problem, global variance reduction methods, like FedVARP, leverage stale model updates for non-participating clients. These methods are effective under homogeneous client participation. Yet, this paper shows that, when some clients participate much less than others, aggregating updates with different levels of staleness can detrimentally affect the training process.

By adjusting the weight in the convex combination, FedStale interpolates between FedAvg, which only uses fresh updates, and FedVARP, which treats fresh and stale updates equally. Our analysis of FedStale convergence yields the following novel findings: i) it integrates and extends previous FedAvg and FedVARP analyses to heterogeneous client participation; ii) it underscores how the least participating client influences convergence error; iii) it provides practical guidelines to best exploit stale updates, showing that their usefulness diminishes as data heterogeneity decreases and participation heterogeneity increases.

In the typical NeRF workflow, the camera poses and the interior orientation are estimated in advance with Structure from Motion (SfM). But the quality of the resulting novel views, which depends on different parameters such as the number and distribution of available images, as well as the accuracy of the related camera poses and interior orientation, is difficult to predict.

Drift analysis is a state-of-the-art tool for estimating the runtime of randomised algorithms, such as evolutionary and bandit algorithms. Drift refers roughly to the expected progress towards the optimum per iteration. This paper considers the problem of deriving concentration tail-bounds on the runtime/regret of algorithms. It provides a novel drift theorem that gives precise exponential tail-bounds given positive, weak, zero and even negative drift. Previously, such exponential tail bounds were missing in the case of weak, zero, or negative drift. Our drift theorem can be used to prove a strong concentration of the runtime/regret of algorithms in AI. For example, we prove that the regret of the \\rwab bandit algorithm is highly concentrated, while previous analyses only considered the expected regret. This means that the algorithm obtains the optimum within a given time frame with high probability, i.e. a form of algorithm reliability. Moreover, our theorem implies that the time needed by the co-evolutionary algorithm RLS-PD to obtain a Nash equilibrium in a \\bilinear max-min-benchmark problem is highly concentrated. However, we also prove that the algorithm forgets the Nash equilibrium, and the time until this occurs is highly concentrated.

Good teachers must therefore simultaneously infer what students already know and adapt their teaching to students' changing state of knowledge. There is increasing interest in using computational models, particularly large language models, as pedagogical tools. As students, language models in particular have shown a remarkable ability to adapt to new tasks given small numbers of examples. But how effectively can these models adapt as teachers to students of different types? To study this question, we introduce a suite of models and evaluation methods we call AdapT. AdapT has two components: (1) a collection of simulated Bayesian student models that can be used for evaluation of automated teaching methods; (2) a platform for evaluation with human students, to characterize the real-world effectiveness of these methods. We additionally introduce (3) AToM, a new probabilistic model for adaptive teaching that jointly infers students' past beliefs and optimizes for the correctness of future beliefs. In evaluations of simulated students across three learning domains (fraction arithmetic, English morphology, function learning), AToM systematically outperforms LLM-based and standard Bayesian teaching models. In human experiments, both AToM and LLMs outperform non-adaptive random example selection.

However, the advent of the Transformer technology with parallelizable self-attention at its core marked the dawn of a new era, outpacing LSTMs at scale. We now raise a simple question: How far do we get in language modeling when scaling LSTMs to billions of parameters, leveraging the latest techniques from modern LLMs, but mitigating known limitations of LSTMs? Firstly, we introduce exponential gating with appropriate normalization and stabilization techniques. Secondly, we modify the LSTM memory structure, obtaining: (i) sLSTM with a scalar memory, a scalar update, and new memory mixing, (ii) mLSTM that is fully parallelizable with a matrix memory and a covariance update rule. Integrating these LSTM extensions into residual block backbones yields xLSTM blocks that are then residually stacked into xLSTM architectures. Exponential gating and modified memory structures boost xLSTM capabilities to perform favorably when compared to state-of-the-art Transformers and State Space Models, both in performance and scaling.","creator":"Maximilian Beck, Korbinian P\\\"oppel, Markus Spanring, Andreas Auer, Oleksandra Prudnikova, Michael Kopp, G\\\"unter Klambauer, Johannes Brandstetter, Sepp Hochreiter"},{"id":"2405.04532","slug":"qserve-w4a8kv4-quantization-and-system-co-design-for-efficient-llm-serving","title":"QServe: W4A8KV4 Quantization and System Co-design for Efficient LLM Serving","link":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04532","abstract":"arXiv:2405.04532v1 Announce Type: cross  Abstract: Quantization can accelerate large language model (LLM) inference. Going beyond INT8 quantization, the research community is actively exploring even lower precision, such as INT4. Nonetheless, state-of-the-art INT4 quantization techniques only accelerate low-batch, edge LLM inference, failing to deliver performance gains in large-batch, cloud-based LLM serving. We uncover a critical issue: existing INT4 quantization methods suffer from significant runtime overhead (20-90%) when dequantizing either weights or partial sums on GPUs. To address this challenge, we introduce QoQ, a W4A8KV4 quantization algorithm with 4-bit weight, 8-bit activation, and 4-bit KV cache. QoQ stands for quattuor-octo-quattuor, which represents 4-8-4 in Latin. QoQ is implemented by the QServe inference library that achieves measured speedup. The key insight driving QServe is that the efficiency of LLM serving on GPUs is critically influenced by operations on low-throughput CUDA cores. Building upon this insight, in QoQ algorithm, we introduce progressive quantization that can allow low dequantization overhead in W4A8 GEMM. Additionally, we develop SmoothAttention to effectively mitigate the accuracy degradation incurred by 4-bit KV quantization. In the QServe system, we perform compute-aware weight reordering and take advantage of register-level parallelism to reduce dequantization latency. We also make fused attention memory-bound, harnessing the performance gain brought by KV4 quantization. As a result, QServe improves the maximum achievable serving throughput of Llama-3-8B by 1.2x on A100, 1.4x on L40S; and Qwen1.5-72B by 2.4x on A100, 3.5x on L40S, compared to TensorRT-LLM. Remarkably, QServe on L40S GPU can achieve even higher throughput than TensorRT-LLM on A100. Thus, QServe effectively reduces the dollar cost of LLM serving by 3x.

Despite this, there has been little theoretical understanding of what they should learn, how to train them, and why we do so. This lack of understanding has resulted in the adoption of diverse training targets (suboptimal vs optimal costs vs admissible heuristics) and loss functions (e.g., square vs absolute errors) in the literature. In this work, we focus on how to effectively utilize the information provided by admissible heuristics in heuristic learning. We argue that learning from poly-time admissible heuristics by minimizing mean square errors (MSE) is not the correct approach, since its result is merely a noisy, inadmissible copy of an efficiently computable heuristic. Instead, we propose to model the learned heuristic as a truncated gaussian, where admissible heuristics are used not as training targets but as lower bounds of this distribution. This results in a different loss function from the MSE commonly employed in the literature, which implicitly models the learned heuristic as a gaussian distribution. We conduct experiments where both MSE and our novel loss function are applied to learning a heuristic from optimal plan costs. Results show that our proposed method converges faster during training and yields better heuristics.","creator":"Carlos N\\'u\\~nez-Molina, Masataro Asai, Pablo Mesejo, Juan Fern\\'andez-Olivares"},{"id":"2310.08842","slug":"a-case-based-persistent-memory-for-a-large-language-model","title":"A Case-Based Persistent Memory for a Large Language Model","link":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08842","abstract":"arXiv:2310.08842v2 Announce Type: replace  Abstract: Case-based reasoning (CBR) as a methodology for problem-solving can use any appropriate computational technique.

Though MTSP has been widely studied, obtaining near-optimal solutions for large-scale problems is still challenging due to its NP-hardness. Recent efforts in data-driven methods face challenges of the need for hard-to-obtain supervision and issues with high variance in gradient estimations, leading to slow convergence and highly suboptimal solutions. We address these issues by reformulating MTSP as a bilevel optimization problem, using the concept of imperative learning (IL). This involves introducing an allocation network that decomposes the MTSP into multiple single-agent traveling salesman problems (TSPs). The longest tour from these TSP solutions is then used to self-supervise the allocation network, resulting in a new self-supervised, bilevel, end-to-end learning framework, which we refer to as imperative MTSP (iMTSP). Additionally, to tackle the high-variance gradient issues during the optimization, we introduce a control variate-based gradient estimation algorithm. Our experiments showed that these innovative designs enable our gradient estimator to converge 20% faster than the advanced reinforcement learning baseline and find up to 80% shorter tour length compared with Google OR-Tools MTSP solver, especially in large-scale problems (e.g. 1000 cities and 15 agents).","creator":"Yifan Guo, Zhongqiang Ren, Chen Wang"},{"id":"2104.02726","slug":"creativity-and-machine-learning-a-survey","title":"Creativity and Machine Learning: A Survey","link":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.02726","abstract":"arXiv:2104.02726v5 Announce Type: replace-cross  Abstract: There is a growing interest in the area of machine learning and creativity.

It is a common practice to learn informative user and item representations by performing embedding propagation on a user-item bipartite graph, and then provide the users with personalized item suggestions based on the representations. Despite effectiveness, existing algorithms neglect precious interactive features between user-item pairs in the embedding process. When predicting a user's preference for different items, they still aggregate the user tree in the same way, without emphasizing target-related information in the user neighborhood. Such a uniform aggregation scheme easily leads to suboptimal user and item representations, limiting the model expressiveness to some extent.   In this work, we address this problem by building bilateral interactive guidance between each user-item pair and proposing a new model named IA-GCN (short for InterActive GCN). Specifically, when learning the user representation from its neighborhood, we assign higher attention weights to those neighbors similar to the target item. Correspondingly, when learning the item representation, we pay more attention to those neighbors resembling the target user. This leads to interactive and interpretable features, effectively distilling target-specific information through each graph convolutional operation.

Our experiments show that background removal can effectively work for fashion data in simple and shallow networks that are not susceptible to overfitting. It can improve model accuracy by up to 5% in the classification on the FashionStyle14 dataset when training models from scratch. However, background removal does not perform well in deep neural networks due to incompatibility with other regularization techniques like batch normalization, pre-trained initialization, and data augmentations introducing randomness. The loss of background pixels invalidates many existing training tricks in the model training, adding the risk of overfitting for deep models.","creator":"Junhui Liang, Ying Liu, Vladimir Vlassov"},{"id":"2308.10720","slug":"on-the-accuracy-of-interpolation-based-on-single-layer-artificial-neural-networks-with-a-focus-on-defeating-the-runge-phenomenon","title":"On the accuracy of interpolation based on single-layer artificial neural networks with a focus on defeating the Runge phenomenon","link":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.10720","abstract":"arXiv:2308.10720v2 Announce Type: replace-cross  Abstract: In the present paper, we consider one-hidden layer ANNs with a feedforward architecture, also referred to as shallow or two-layer networks, so that the structure is determined by the number and types of neurons. The determination of the parameters that define the function, called training, is done via the resolution of the approximation problem, so by imposing the interpolation through a set of specific nodes. We present the case where the parameters are trained using a procedure that is referred to as Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) that leads to a linear interpolation problem. In such hypotheses, the existence of an ANN interpolating function is guaranteed. The focus is then on the accuracy of the interpolation outside of the given sampling interpolation nodes when they are the equispaced, the Chebychev, and the randomly selected ones. The study is motivated by the well-known bell-shaped Runge example, which makes it clear that the construction of a global interpolating polynomial is accurate only if trained on suitably chosen nodes, ad example the Chebychev ones. In order to evaluate the behavior when growing the number of interpolation nodes, we raise the number of neurons in our network and compare it with the interpolating polynomial. We test using Runge's function and other well-known examples with different regularities. As expected, the accuracy of the approximation with a global polynomial increases only if the Chebychev nodes are considered. Instead, the error for the ANN interpolating function always decays and in most cases we observe that the convergence follows what is observed in the polynomial case on Chebychev nodes, despite the set of nodes used for training.","creator":"Ferdinando Auricchio, Maria Roberta Belardo, Gianluca Fabiani, Francesco Calabr\\`o, Ariel F.

The typical paradigm is to pre-train a big deep learning model on large-scale data sets, and then fine-tune the model on small task-specific data sets for downstream tasks. Although PTMs have rapidly progressed with wide real-world applications, they also pose significant risks of potential attacks. Existing backdoor attacks or data poisoning methods often build up the assumption that the attacker invades the computers of victims or accesses the target data, which is challenging in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for an invisible attack on PTMs with enhanced MD5 collision. The key idea is to generate two equal-size models with the same MD5 checksum by leveraging the MD5 chosen-prefix collision. Afterwards, the two ``same\" models will be deployed on public websites to induce victims to download the poisoned model. Unlike conventional attacks on deep learning models, this new attack is flexible, covert, and model-independent.

The traditional ID-based models for CTR prediction take as inputs the one-hot encoded ID features of tabular modality, which capture the collaborative signals via feature interaction modeling. But the one-hot encoding discards the semantic information conceived in the original feature texts. Recently, the emergence of Pretrained Language Models (PLMs) has given rise to another paradigm, which takes as inputs the sentences of textual modality obtained by hard prompt templates and adopts PLMs to extract the semantic knowledge. However, PLMs generally tokenize the input text data into subword tokens and ignore field-wise collaborative signals. Therefore, these two lines of research focus on different characteristics of the same input data (i.e., textual and tabular modalities), forming a distinct complementary relationship with each other. In this paper, we propose to conduct Fine-grained feature-level ALignment between ID-based Models and Pretrained Language Models (FLIP) for CTR prediction. We design a novel joint reconstruction pretraining task for both masked language and tabular modeling. Specifically, the masked data of one modality (i.e., tokens or features) has to be recovered with the help of the other modality, which establishes the feature-level interaction and alignment via sufficient mutual information extraction between dual modalities. Moreover, we propose to jointly finetune the ID-based model and PLM for downstream CTR prediction tasks, thus achieving superior performance by combining the advantages of both models.

We show that decentralized agents trained in our environment exhibit strong generalization abilities when confronted with novel objects at test time. Additionally, despite never being forced to cooperate during training the agents learn collective exploration strategies which allow them to solve novel tasks never encountered during training.

To overcome these challenges, researchers have aimed to simulate incomplete conditions during the training phase to enhance the system's overall robustness. Traditional methods have often involved discarding data or substituting data segments with zero vectors to approximate these incompletenesses. However, such approaches neither accurately represent real-world conditions nor adequately address the issue of noisy data availability. For instance, a blurry image cannot be simply replaced with zero vectors, and still retain information. To tackle this issue and develop a more precise MER system, we introduce a novel noise-robust MER model that effectively learns robust multimodal joint representations from noisy data. This approach includes two pivotal components: firstly, a noise scheduler that adjusts the type and level of noise in the data to emulate various realistic incomplete situations. Secondly, a Variational AutoEncoder (VAE)-based module is employed to reconstruct these robust multimodal joint representations from the noisy inputs. Notably, the introduction of the noise scheduler enables the exploration of an entirely new type of incomplete data condition, which is impossible with existing methods.

Existing studies of AI-generated text detection for hybrid texts often rely on synthetic datasets. These typically involve hybrid texts with a limited number of boundaries. We contend that studies of detecting AI-generated content within hybrid texts should cover different types of hybrid texts generated in realistic settings to better inform real-world applications. Therefore, our study utilizes the CoAuthor dataset, which includes diverse, realistic hybrid texts generated through the collaboration between human writers and an intelligent writing system in multi-turn interactions. We adopt a two-step, segmentation-based pipeline: (i) detect segments within a given hybrid text where each segment contains sentences of consistent authorship, and (ii) classify the authorship of each identified segment. Our empirical findings highlight (1) detecting AI-generated sentences in hybrid texts is overall a challenging task because (1.1) human writers' selecting and even editing AI-generated sentences based on personal preferences adds difficulty in identifying the authorship of segments; (1.2) the frequent change of authorship between neighboring sentences within the hybrid text creates difficulties for segment detectors in identifying authorship-consistent segments; (1.3) the short length of text segments within hybrid texts provides limited stylistic cues for reliable authorship determination; (2) before embarking on the detection process, it is beneficial to assess the average length of segments within the hybrid text. This assessment aids in deciding whether (2.1) to employ a text segmentation-based strategy for hybrid texts with longer segments, or (2.2) to adopt a direct sentence-by-sentence classification strategy for those with shorter segments.","creator":"Zijie Zeng, Shiqi Liu, Lele Sha, Zhuang Li, Kaixun Yang, Sannyuya Liu, Dragan Ga\\v{s}evi\\'c, Guanliang Chen"},{"id":"2403.06064","slug":"l-2-gc-lorentzian-linear-graph-convolutional-networks-for-node-classification","title":"L$^2$GC: Lorentzian Linear Graph Convolutional Networks For Node Classification","link":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06064","abstract":"arXiv:2403.06064v2 Announce Type: replace-cross  Abstract: Linear Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) are used to classify the node in the graph data.

To ensure that LLMs do not generate unsafe responses, they are aligned with safeguards that specify what content is restricted. However, such alignment can be bypassed to produce prohibited content using a technique commonly referred to as jailbreak. Different systems have been proposed to perform the jailbreak automatically. These systems rely on evaluation methods to determine whether a jailbreak attempt is successful. However, our analysis reveals that current jailbreak evaluation methods have two limitations. (1) Their objectives lack clarity and do not align with the goal of identifying unsafe responses. (2) They oversimplify the jailbreak result as a binary outcome, successful or not. In this paper, we propose three metrics, safeguard violation, informativeness, and relative truthfulness, to evaluate language model jailbreak.

To compute these metrics, we introduce a multifaceted approach that extends the natural language generation evaluation method after preprocessing the response. We evaluate our metrics on a benchmark dataset produced from three malicious intent datasets and three jailbreak systems. The benchmark dataset is labeled by three annotators. We compare our multifaceted approach with three existing jailbreak evaluation methods.

However, human gaze patterns are heterogeneous and varying behaviors can significantly affect the outcomes of such human-robot interactions. To fill this gap, we developed a deep learning-based social cue integration model for saliency prediction to instead predict scanpaths in videos.

We observed that the late neural integration approach surpasses early fusion when training models on a large dataset, in comparison to a smaller dataset with a similar distribution. Results also indicate that a single unified model, trained on all the observers' scanpaths, performs on par or better than individually trained models.

Given the highly divergent ontogeny of the dominant gametophyte (bryophytes) and sporophyte (angiosperms) generations, however, it is unclear whether such differences derive from distinct phylogeny or ontogeny. Here, we address this question by comparing a range of physiological, developmental and molecular responses to auxin in both generations of the model fern Ceratopteris richardii. We find that auxin response in Ceratopteris gametophytes closely resembles that of a thalloid bryophyte, whereas the sporophyte mimics auxin response in flowering plants. This resemblance manifests both at phenotypic and transcriptional level. Furthermore, we show that disrupting auxin transport can lead to ectopic sporophyte induction on the gametophyte, suggesting a role for auxin in the alternation of generations.

In addition, WHIRLY1 has a second localization in the nucleus making it an excellent candidate for chloroplast-to-nucleus communication. To unravel the role of WHIRLY1 for structure and protein composition of nucleoids and its potential involvement in retrograde signaling during chloroplast development, knockout mutants of HvWHIRLY1 were prepared by site-directed mutagenesis using Cas9 endonuclease. In contrast to mutants of rice and maize, which die after the seedling stage, the barley why1 mutants survive and produce grains. Leaves of the mutants are initially pale and get green with time (xantha-to-green phenotype). However, the chlorophyll content of primary leaves stayed distinctly lower than that of the wild-type leaves, coinciding with a rather heterogeneous plastid population, whereby only 50% developed a rather normal thylakoid membrane system. For comparison, mature foliage leaves had almost normal levels of chlorophyll but a severely reduced photosynthetic capacity. A proteome analysis of chloroplasts isolated from mature foliage leaves revealed that in the absence of WHIRLY1, the abundances of a considerable fraction of proteins were down-regulated. The fraction included multiple nucleoid-associated proteins including components of the transcriptional apparatus. Furthermore, ribosomal proteins, subunits of pyruvate dehydrogenase, CLP protease, ATP synthase, Rubisco and chaperons/chaperonins were found to be downregulated. In conclusion, the characterization of the barley why1 mutant plants revealed that WHIRLY1 is not essential for chloroplast development. Rather, it ensures a fast and failure-free pro-gression of chloroplast development by remodeling nucleoids, which serve as assembly plat-forms for a concerted workflow of the numerous processes required for chloroplast develop-ment.

We have previously discovered that a simple amino acid, tryptophan (Trp), as well as its metabolite, the plant hormone indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), can inhibit radicle elongation of Orobanche minor. These results suggest that auxin plays a crucial role in the radicle elongation step in root parasitic plants. In this report, we used various auxin chemical probes to dissect the auxin function in the radicle growth of O. minor and Striga hermonthica.

Moreover, a polar transport inhibitor of auxin, N-1-naphthylphthalamic acid (NPA), affected radicle tropism. We also proved that exogenously applied Trp is converted into IAA in O. minor seeds, and auxinole partly rescued this radicle elongation. Our data demonstrate a pivotal role of auxin in radicle growth.

The primed state of plants is correlated with a more rapid and efficient response, achievable by subjecting plants to recurrent stressors. Consequently, priming constitutes a dynamic transitional process between two distinct biological states, necessitating the establishment and maintenance of transcriptional memory mechanisms. Research on transcriptional memory has revealed molecular mechanisms including protein and transcription factor accumulation, as well as epigenetic modulations. Nonetheless, there remains a dearth of understanding regarding the interplay among the dynamics of transcriptional stress memory, its preservation, and the resultant emergent properties conferred upon the organism once primed. Here, we found that the robustness of transcriptional memory associated with repeated mechanical stimuli played an antagonistic role in the priming of plant defense. Incorporating experiments and computational modeling, we have analyzed the transcriptional stress memory of Arabidopsis thaliana subjected to daily acoustic stimulations. The observed enhanced resistance to the pathogen Sclerotinia sclerotiorum following three rounds of repeated acoustic stimulations is attributed to three primary mechanisms: the activation of a first line of defense in non-inoculated plants, an increase defense-associated gene diversification, and gene priming. These mechanisms are sustained by a transcriptional stress memory involving thousands of genes, likely regulated mostly by transcription factor cascades. Upon comparing the predictions of the transcriptional stress memory model with experimental outcomes, we propose that priming does not arise from the sequential activation of different pathways but rather from the simultaneous modulation of a broad spectrum of pathways. Pathway redundancy in the transcriptional memory topology imparts robustness to plant defense priming. Consequently, primed plants exhibit independence from limited genetic variations, preventing critical loss of resistance observed in naive plants. Pathway redundancies also imply strong limitations in increasing plant defense. Thus, plants remain unaffected by an increase in the daily rate of RAS and exhibited a stress memorization time limited to 1.5 days.","creator":"Hadj-Amor, K., Leger, O., Raffaele, S., Kovacic, M., Duclos, A., Carvalho-Silva, P., Garcia, F., Barbacci, A."},{"id":"2024.05.02.592228v1","slug":"multiomic-analysis-of-genes-related-to-oil-traits-in-legumes-provide-insights-into-lipid-metabolism-and-oil-richness-in-soybean","title":"Multiomic analysis of genes related to oil traits in legumes provide insights into lipid metabolism and oil richness in soybean","link":"http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2024.05.02.592228v1?rss=1","abstract":"Soybean (Glycine max) and common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) diverged approximately 19 million years ago.

In a greenhouse pot experiment, we investigated the stand-alone and synergistic effects of SHS mulch (10 mm-thickness) and biochar (2% w/w) on Moringa oleifera plants under normal (N, 100% field capacity) and reduced (R, 50% of N) irrigation scenarios. Under N and R, SHS mulch reduced evaporation by 71% and 64%, respectively; while SHS+biochar reduced evaporation by 61% and 47%, respectively, in comparison with the control (p < 0.05). Total transpiration significantly increased in SHS plants by 311% and 385% under N and R, respectively. Compared with the control, transpiration increased in biochar-amended plants by 103% and 110%; whereas, its combination with SHS increased transpiration by 288% and 301% under N and R, respectively (p < 0.05). Irrespective of the irrigation regimes, we found superior effects of SHS, biochar, and their combination on plant height (62-140%), trunk diameter (52-91%), leaf area index (57-145%), leaf chlorophyll content index (11-19%), stomatal conductance (51-175%), as well as shoot (390-1271%) and root (52-142%) biomass, in comparison with the controls. Metabolomics analysis showed significantly higher relative abundance of amino acids, sugars, fatty acids, and organic acids in the leaves of control plants relative to other treatments, as a response to water or nutrient stress induced by excessive water loss through evaporation. Next, we found a higher concentration of D-Mannose, D-Fructose, glucose, and malic acid in plants grown with SHS or biochar treatment under N and R irrigation, attributed to increased water/nutrient-use efficiency and carbon assimilation because of higher photosynthesis rates than in the control plants. Our results show that, our complementary technologies could address the challenge of water loss via evaporation from soil and maximize soil nutrient retention for improving plant growth in arid regions. This could underscore the success and sustainability of irrigated agriculture and greening efforts in arid lands.","creator":"Odokonyero, K., Vernooij, B., Albar, B., Exposito, L.

In Brassicaceae, there is high genetic diversity at the locus controlling self-incompatibility, and dozens of distinct alleles are organized in a complex dominance hierarchy: the gene controlling self-incompatibility specificity in pollen shows monoallelic expression in heterozygote individuals. This is achieved through the action of sRNA precursors that resemble miRNAs, although the underlying molecular mechanisms remain elusive. Here, we engineered Arabidopsis thaliana lines expressing components of the Arabidopsis halleri self-incompatibility system, and used a reverse genetics approach to pinpoint the pathways underlying the function of these sRNA precursors. We showed that they trigger a robust decrease in transcript abundance of the recessive pollen self-incompatibility genes, but not through the canonical transcriptional or post-transcriptional gene silencing pathways. Furthermore, we observed that single sRNA precursors are typically processed into hundreds of sRNA molecules of distinct sizes, abundance levels and ARGONAUTE loading preferences. This heterogeneity closely resembles that of proto-miRNAs, the evolutionary ancestors of miRNAs. Our results suggest that these apparently arbitrary features, which are often associated with lack of effects on gene expression, are crucial in the context of the self-incompatibility dominance hierarchy since they allow for one sRNA precursor of a given allele to repress multiple other recessive alleles. This study not only provides an in-depth characterization of the molecular features underlying complex dominance interactions, but also constitutes a unique example of how specific evolutionary constraints shape the progression of sRNA precursors along the proto-miRNA - miRNA evolutionary continuum.","creator":"Batista, R.

Freezing stress severely damages the fruitlets, resulting in loss of fruit yield and quality. Studies have shown that Ca2+, as a second messenger, is involved in signal transduction in loquat fruitlets under freezing stress. However, the mechanism of downstream calcium signal transduction in loquat fruitlets under freezing stress is currently unclear. Calcium-depend protein kinase (CDPK) as the most particular calcium sensor family in plants, play an important role in multiple stress signal transduction including freezing. In this study, we identified the loquat CDPK family on a genome-wide scale. A total of 34 EjCDPK genes were identified and studied for basic structural and phylogenetic features. EjCDPKs can be divided into four subgroups phylogenetically. The patterns of exon-intron and protein motif are highly conserved among the subgroups. Collinearity analysis identified several segmental duplicate events in EjCDPK family. RNA-seq based transcription analysis indicated that partial of EjCDPKs differently expressed in response to freezing stress with tissue-specific. Moreover, we preformed correlation analysis between expression value and trait data of loquat fruitlet under freezing stress by weighted co-expression gene network. After that, EjCDPK25 was selected as the candidate because of its potential freezing stress response function. Protein kinase related GO terms were enriched in EjCDPK25 co-expression genes, and then QPCR was performed to examine the target genes expression pattern. In addition, EjCDPK25 was cloned to construct overexpression vector to obtain transgenic Arabidopsis plants. Transgenic and wild-type Arabidopsis were suffered freezing stress treatments (-5{degrees}C). The results showed that the survival rate of EjCDPK25 overexpressing transgenic Arabidopsis was significantly higher than WT. In summary, this study identified loquat CDPK family firstly, and our data provide significant insights into the evolution and function of loquat CDPKs.

Xoo strain PXO99A encodes nineteen TALEs, but the host targets of all these TALEs have not been defined. A meta-analysis of rice transcriptome profiles revealed a gene annotated as flavonol synthase/flavanone-3 hydroxylase (henceforth OsS5H/FNS-03g) to be highly induced upon Xoo infection.

OsS5H/FNS-03g functionally complemented its Arabidopsis homologue AtDMR6, a well-studied disease susceptibility locus.

This study aims to understand the 3D model structure of enzymes involved in fatty acid synthesis, and their catalytic sites compared to other Scenedesmus species.

Mining the genome sequence of our isolated S. quadricauda LWG002611 as well as other Scenedesmus sequences taken from PhycoCosm and NCBI, we identified sequences of the crucial enzymes involved in fatty acid biosynthesis pathways such as acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), malonyl-CoA:ACP transacylase (MAT) and fatty-acyl thioesterases (FAT) for comparative study on homology, catalytic sites, domains, and protein 3D models. Detailed comparative analyses of these identified enzymes were carried out using various bioinformatics tools. Which demonstrated highly significant sequence similarity with homologs of bacteria as well as with homologs of lower groups of eukaryotes suggesting an evolutionary linkage with them. The molecular modeling and 3D structures of the chloroplastic enzymes by AlphaFold Multimer revealed the overall structural orientation and well-conserved catalytic residues.

Species distributions are shifting or decreasing, with alpine plant species being particularly threatened. Natural population monitoring allows the assessment of the impact of human-induced global changes. However, traditional monitoring strategies based on individual counts may produce delayed signals of biodiversity loss. These approaches overlook the fact that genetic diversity is the fundamental basis for evolutionary processes, as it enables populations to adapt to environmental changes, including those caused by climate change. Here, we draw attention to the use of genetic diversity in monitoring schemes to anticipate negative trends in biodiversity and propose two fundamental methodologies: genomics and the use of herbarium specimens. Firstly, in contrast to genetic markers conventionally used to quantify genetic diversity, such as microsatellite markers, genomic approaches provide a vast amount of data that does not require previous knowledge of the studied organism, making them suitable for the study of non-model species. Secondly, herbaria worldwide serve as excellent sources of plant material for comparative studies across time with their precise chronologically recorded collection data. The accuracy of genetic diversity estimates increases with sample size, therefore a large number of vouchers is ideally required. However, the availability of specimens from the same species and populations in public herbaria is limited. Different strategies to quantify genetic diversity are proposed depending on the number of specimens available and their geographic distribution. Finally, we illustrate the potential of this approach in the most restrictive scenario, where only a few individuals are available, and there is no conspecific reference genome. Even in this restrictive scenario, there are signs of genetic depauperation in an alpine species with a narrow distribution, but not in a widely distributed congeneric.","creator":"Viveiros-Moniz, M., Garcia-Munoz, A., Matias, L., Abdelaziz, M., Munoz-Pajares, A.

The GENERAL CONTROL NON-DEREPRESSIBLE 5 (GCN5) is a HAT that specifically acetylates H3K14 residues. GCN5 has been associated with cell division and differentiation, meristem function, root, stem, foliar and floral development, and plant environmental response. The flowers of gcn5-6 plants display reduced length of stamen and exhibit male sterility relative to the wild-type plants. We show these effects may arise from gibberellin (GA) signaling defects. The signaling pathway of bioactive GAs depends on the proteolysis of their repressors, DELLA proteins. The DELLA protein, REPRESSOR OF GA (RGA), represses plant growth, inflorescence, flower and seed development. Our molecular data indicate that GCN5 is required for activation and H3K14 acetylation of genes involved in the late stages of GA biosynthesis and catabolism. We studied the genetic interaction of RGA and GCN5; RGA can partially suppress GCN5 action. The reduced elongation of the stamen filament of gcn5-6 mutants is reversed in the rga-t2;gcn5-6 double mutants. This mechanism involved suppressing the GCN5 effect on the expression and histone acetylation in GAI-locus by RGA. Interestingly, RGA and RGL2 do not suppress ADA2b function, suggesting that ADA2b acts downstream in GA signaling and is distinct from GCN5 activity. In conclusion, we propose that the action of GCN5 on stamen elongation is mediated partially by RGA and GA signaling.","creator":"Balouri, C., Poulios, S., Tsompani, D., Spyropoulou, Z., Ketikoglou, M.-C., Kaldis, A., Doonan, J.

Similar to standard fixed effects (FE) model, my model allows arbitrary dependence between regressors and unobserved heterogeneity, but it generalizes the additive separability of standard FE to allow the unobserved heterogeneity to enter nonseparably. Similar to structural quantile models, my model's random coefficient vector depends on an unobserved, scalar ''rank'' variable, in which outcomes (excluding an additive noise term) are monotonic at a particular value of the regressor vector, which is much weaker than the conventional monotonicity assumption that must hold at all possible values. This rank is assumed to be stable over time, which is often more economically plausible than the panel quantile studies that assume individual rank is iid over time. It uncovers the heterogeneous causal effects as functions of the rank variable. I provide identification and estimation results, establishing uniform consistency and uniform asymptotic normality of the heterogeneous causal effect function estimator. Simulations show reasonable finite-sample performance and show my model complements fixed effects quantile regression. Finally, I illustrate the proposed methods by examining the causal effect of a country's oil wealth on its military defense spending.","creator":"Xin Liu"},{"id":"2405.03893","slug":"large-effects-of-small-cues-priming-selfish-economic-decisions","title":"Large Effects of Small Cues: Priming Selfish Economic Decisions","link":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03893","abstract":"Abstract: Many experimental studies report that economics students tend to act more selfishly than students of other disciplines, a finding that received widespread public and professional attention. Two main explanations that the existing literature offers for the differences found in the behavior between economists and noneconomists are the selection effect, and the indoctrination effect. We offer an alternative, novel explanation. We argue that these differences can be explained by differences in the interpretation of the context. We test this hypothesis by conducting two social dilemma experiments in the US and Israel with participants from both economics and non-economics majors. In the experiments, participants face a tradeoff between profit maximization, that is the market norm and workers welfare, that is the social norm. We use priming to manipulate the cues that the participants receive before they make their decision. We find that when participants receive cues signaling that the decision has an economic context, both economics and non-economics students tend to maximize profits. When the participants receive cues emphasizing social norms, on the other hand, both economics and non-economics students are less likely to maximize profits. We conclude that some of the differences found between the decisions of economics and non-economics students can be explained by contextual cues.","creator":"Avichai Snir, Dudi Levy, Dian Wang, Haipeng Allan Chen, Daniel Levy"},{"id":"2405.03910","slug":"a-primer-on-the-analysis-of-randomized-experiments-and-a-survey-of-some-recent-advances","title":"A Primer on the Analysis of Randomized Experiments and a Survey of some Recent Advances","link":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03910","abstract":"Abstract: The past two decades have witnessed a surge of new research in the analysis of randomized experiments.

Despite their ubiquity, the economic implications of return to office policies are not fully understood. Using 260 million resumes matched to company data, we analyze the causal effects of such policies on employees' tenure and seniority levels at three of the largest US tech companies: Microsoft, SpaceX, and Apple. Our estimation procedure is nonparametric and captures the full heterogeneity of tenure and seniority of employees in a distributional synthetic controls framework. We estimate a reduction in counterfactual tenure that increases for employees with longer tenure. Similarly, we document a leftward shift in the seniority distribution towards positions below the senior level. These shifts appear to be driven by employees leaving to larger firms that are direct competitors. Our results suggest that return to office policies can lead to an outflow of senior employees, posing a potential threat to the productivity, innovation, and competitiveness of the wider firm.","creator":"David Van Dijcke, Florian Gunsilius, Austin Wright"},{"id":"2405.04365","slug":"detailed-gender-wage-gap-decompositions-controlling-for-worker-unobserved-heterogeneity-using-network-theory","title":"Detailed Gender Wage Gap Decompositions: Controlling for Worker Unobserved Heterogeneity Using Network Theory","link":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04365","abstract":"Abstract: Recent advances in the literature of decomposition methods in economics have allowed for the identification and estimation of detailed wage gap decompositions. In this context, building reliable counterfactuals requires using tighter controls to ensure that similar workers are correctly identified by making sure that important unobserved variables such as skills are controlled for, as well as comparing only workers with similar observable characteristics. This paper contributes to the wage decomposition literature in two main ways: (i) developing an economic principled network based approach to control for unobserved worker skills heterogeneity in the presence of potential discrimination; and (ii) extending existing generic decomposition tools to accommodate for potential lack of overlapping supports in covariates between groups being compared, which is likely to be the norm in more detailed decompositions. We illustrate the methodology by decomposing the gender wage gap in Brazil.","creator":"Jamie Fogel, Bernardo Modenesi"},{"id":"2405.04465","slug":"two-way-fixed-effects-and-differences-in-differences-estimators-in-heterogeneous-adoption-designs","title":"Two-way Fixed Effects and Differences-in-Differences Estimators in Heterogeneous Adoption Designs","link":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04465","abstract":"Abstract: We consider treatment-effect estimation under a parallel trends assumption, in heterogeneous adoption designs where no unit is treated at period one, and units receive a weakly positive dose at period two. First, we develop a test of the assumption that the treatment effect is mean independent of the treatment, under which the commonly-used two-way-fixed-effects estimator is consistent. When this test is rejected, we propose alternative, robust estimators. If there are stayers with a period-two treatment equal to 0, the robust estimator is a difference-in-differences (DID) estimator using stayers as the control group. If there are quasi-stayers with a period-two treatment arbitrarily close to zero, the robust estimator is a DID using units with a period-two treatment below a bandwidth as controls. Finally, without stayers or quasi-stayers, we propose non-parametric bounds, and an estimator relying on a parametric specification of treatment-effect heterogeneity. We use our results to revisit Pierce and Schott (2016) and Enikolopov et al.

A principal who can only commit to one-period contracts wants to screen efficient agents over time. Once an agent reveals his type, the principal becomes tempted to revise contract terms, causing a \"ratchet effect.\" Alterations of contracts are observable and, hence, whenever past promises are not honored future information revelation stops. We provide a necessary and sufficient condition under which the principal is able to foster information revelation. When players are sufficiently patient, the agents' private information is either never revealed or fully revealed in a sequential manner. Optimal contracts entail high-powered incentives after an agent's type is initially disclosed, and rewards for information revelation disappear in the long run.","creator":"Mehmet Ekmekci, Lucas Maestri, Dong Wei"},{"id":"2405.03701","slug":"qxeai-automated-probabilistic-forecasting-with-quantum-like-evolutionary-algorithm","title":"QxEAI -- Automated probabilistic forecasting with Quantum-like evolutionary algorithm","link":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03701","abstract":"arXiv:2405.03701v1 Announce Type: cross  Abstract: Forecasting, to estimate future events, is crucial for business and decision-making.

The novelty of the proposed test is that it allows the number of covariates and instruments to be larger than the sample size. The test is scale-invariant and is robust to heteroskedastic errors. To construct the final test statistic, we first introduce a test based on the maximum norm of multiple parameters that could be high-dimensional. The theoretical power based on the maximum norm is higher than that in the modified Cragg-Donald test (Koles\\'{a}r, 2018), the only existing test allowing for large-dimensional covariates. Second, following the principle of power enhancement (Fan et al., 2015), we introduce the power-enhanced test, with an asymptotically zero component used to enhance the power to detect some extreme alternatives with many locally invalid instruments. Finally, an empirical example of the trade and economic growth nexus demonstrates the usefulness of the proposed test.","creator":"Qingliang Fan, Zijian Guo, Ziwei Mei"},{"id":"2305.01435","slug":"transfer-estimates-for-causal-effects-across-heterogeneous-sites","title":"Transfer Estimates for Causal Effects across Heterogeneous Sites","link":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.01435","abstract":"arXiv:2305.01435v5 Announce Type: replace  Abstract: We consider the problem of extrapolating treatment effects across heterogeneous populations (``sites\"/``contexts\"). We consider an idealized scenario in which the researcher observes cross-sectional data for a large number of units across several ``experimental\" sites in which an intervention has already been implemented to a new ``target\" site for which a baseline survey of unit-specific, pre-treatment outcomes and relevant attributes is available. Our approach treats the baseline as functional data, and this choice is motivated by the observation that unobserved site-specific confounders manifest themselves not only in average levels of outcomes, but also how these interact with observed unit-specific attributes. We consider the problem of determining the optimal finite-dimensional feature space in which to solve that prediction problem. Our approach is design-based in the sense that the performance of the predictor is evaluated given the specific, finite selection of experimental and target sites. Our approach is nonparametric, and our formal results concern the construction of an optimal basis of predictors as well as convergence rates for the estimated conditional average treatment effect relative to the constrained-optimal population predictor for the target site. We quantify the potential gains from adapting experimental estimates to a target location in an application to conditional cash transfer (CCT) programs using a combined data set from five multi-site randomized controlled trials.","creator":"Konrad Menzel"},{"id":"2310.02253","slug":"estimating-digital-product-trade-through-corporate-revenue-data","title":"Estimating Digital Product Trade through Corporate Revenue Data","link":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02253","abstract":"arXiv:2310.02253v4 Announce Type: replace  Abstract: Despite global efforts to harmonize international trade statistics, our understanding of digital trade and its implications remains limited. Here, we introduce a method to estimate bilateral exports and imports for dozens of sectors starting from the corporate revenue data of large digital firms. This method allows us to provide estimates for digitally ordered and delivered trade involving digital goods (e.g. video games), productized services (e.g. digital advertising), and digital intermediation fees (e.g. hotel rental), which together we call digital products. We use these estimates to study five key aspects of digital trade. We find that, compared to trade in physical goods, digital product exports are more spatially concentrated, have been growing faster, and can offset trade balance estimates, like the United States trade deficit on physical goods. We also find that countries that have decoupled economic growth from greenhouse gas emissions tend to have larger digital exports and that digital products exports contribute positively to the complexity of economies. This method, dataset, and findings provide a new lens to understand the impact of international trade in digital products.","creator":"Viktor Stojkoski, Philipp Koch, Eva Coll, Cesar A.
