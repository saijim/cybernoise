        "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.03387",
        "abstract": "The tremendous growth of social media users interacting in online conversations has also led to significant growth in hate speech. Most of the prior works focus on detecting explicit hate speech, which is overt and leverages hateful phrases, with very little work focusing on detecting hate speech that is implicit or denotes hatred through indirect or coded language. In this paper, we present CoSyn, a user- and conversational-context synergized network for detecting implicit hate speech in online conversation trees. CoSyn first models the user's personal historical and social context using a novel hyperbolic Fourier attention mechanism and hyperbolic graph convolution network. Next, we jointly model the user's personal context and the conversational context using a novel context interaction mechanism in the hyperbolic space that clearly captures the interplay between the two and makes independent assessments on the amounts of information to be retrieved from both contexts. CoSyn performs all operations in the hyperbolic space to account for the scale-free dynamics of social media. We demonstrate the effectiveness of CoSyn both qualitatively and quantitatively on an open-source hate speech dataset with Twitter conversations and show that CoSyn outperforms all our baselines in detecting implicit hate speech with absolute improvements in the range of 8.15% - 19.50%.",

        "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.03388",
        "abstract": "Multi-modal integration and classification based on graph learning is among the most challenging obstacles in disease prediction due to its complexity. Several recent works on the basis of attentional mechanisms have been proposed to disentangle the problem of multi-modal integration. However, there are certain limitations to these techniques. Primarily, these works focus on explicitly integrating at the feature level using weight scores, which cannot effectively address the negative impact between modalities. Next, a majority of them utilize single-sized filters to extract graph features, ignoring the heterogeneous information over graphs. To overcome these drawbacks, we propose MMKGL (Multi-modal Multi-Kernel Graph Learning). For the problem of negative impact between modalities, we use the multi-modal graph embedding module to construct a multi-modal graph. Different from the traditional manual construction of static graphs, a separate graph is generated for each modality by graph adaptive learning, where a function graph and a supervision graph are introduced for optimiztion during the multi-graph fusion embedding process. We then apply the multi-kernel graph learning module to extract heterogeneous information from the multi-modal graph. The information in the multi-modal graph at different levels is aggregated by convolutional kernels with different receptive field sizes, followed by generating a cross-kernel discovery tensor for disease prediction. Our method is evaluated on the benchmark Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE) dataset and outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. In addition, discriminative brain regions associated with autism are identified by our model, providing guidance for the study of autism pathology.",

Although recent methods achieve an extremely high similarity with the ground truth on popular benchmarks, the information contained in the flat partition is limited. In this paper, we introduce CoHiClust, a Contrastive Hierarchical Clustering model based on deep neural networks, which can be applied to typical image data. By employing a self-supervised learning approach, CoHiClust distills the base network into a binary tree without access to any labeled data. The hierarchical clustering structure can be used to analyze the relationship between clusters, as well as to measure the similarity between data points. Experiments demonstrate that CoHiClust generates a reasonable structure of clusters, which is consistent with our intuition and image semantics. Moreover, it obtains superior clustering accuracy on most of the image datasets compared to the state-of-the-art flat clustering models.",

        "abstract": "Controlling agents remotely with deep reinforcement learning~(DRL) in the real world is yet to come. One crucial stepping stone is to devise RL algorithms that are robust in the face of dropped information from corrupted communication or malfunctioning sensors. Typical RL methods usually require considerable online interaction data that are costly and unsafe to collect in the real world. Furthermore, when applying to the frame dropping scenarios, they perform unsatisfactorily even with moderate drop rates. To address these issues, we propose Decision Transformer under Random Frame Dropping~(DeFog), an offline RL algorithm that enables agents to act robustly in frame dropping scenarios without online interaction. DeFog first randomly masks out data in the offline datasets and explicitly adds the time span of frame dropping as inputs. After that, a finetuning stage on the same offline dataset with a higher mask rate would further boost the performance. Empirical results show that DeFog outperforms strong baselines under severe frame drop rates like 90\\%, while maintaining similar returns under non-frame-dropping conditions in the regular MuJoCo control benchmarks and the Atari environments. Our approach offers a robust and deployable solution for controlling agents in real-world environments with limited or unreliable data.",

        "abstract": "Hyper-parameter optimization is one of the most tedious yet crucial steps in training machine learning models. There are numerous methods for this vital model-building stage, ranging from domain-specific manual tuning guidelines suggested by the oracles to the utilization of general-purpose black-box optimization techniques. This paper proposes an agent-based collaborative technique for finding near-optimal values for any arbitrary set of hyper-parameters (or decision variables) in a machine learning model (or general function optimization problem). The developed method forms a hierarchical agent-based architecture for the distribution of the searching operations at different dimensions and employs a cooperative searching procedure based on an adaptive width-based random sampling technique to locate the optima. The behavior of the presented model, specifically against the changes in its design parameters, is investigated in both machine learning and global function optimization applications, and its performance is compared with that of two randomized tuning strategies that are commonly used in practice. According to the empirical results, the proposed model outperformed the compared methods in the experimented classification, regression, and multi-dimensional function optimization tasks, notably in a higher number of dimensions and in the presence of limited on-device computational resources.",

        "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.03395",
        "abstract": "Effective traffic control methods have great potential in alleviating network congestion. Existing literature generally focuses on a single control approach, while few studies have explored the effectiveness of integrated and coordinated control approaches. This study considers two representative control approaches: ramp metering for freeways and perimeter control for homogeneous urban roads, and we aim to develop a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based coordinated control framework for large-scale networks. The main challenges are 1) there is a lack of efficient dynamic models for both freeways and urban roads; 2) the standard DRL method becomes ineffective due to the complex and non-stationary network dynamics. In view of this, we propose a novel meso-macro dynamic network model and first time develop a demonstration-guided DRL method to achieve large-scale coordinated ramp metering and perimeter control. The dynamic network model hybridizes the link and generalized bathtub models to depict the traffic dynamics of freeways and urban roads, respectively. For the DRL method, we incorporate demonstration to guide the DRL method for better convergence by introducing the concept of \"teacher\" and \"student\" models. The teacher models are traditional controllers (e.g., ALINEA, Gating), which provide control demonstrations. The student models are DRL methods, which learn from the teacher and aim to surpass the teacher's performance. To validate the proposed framework, we conduct two case studies in a small-scale network and a real-world large-scale traffic network in Hong Kong. The research outcome reveals the great potential of combining traditional controllers with DRL for coordinated control in large-scale networks.",

        "abstract": "In this work, we develop an Aligned Entropic Reproducing Kernel (AERK) for graph classification. We commence by performing the Continuous-time Quantum Walk (CTQW) on each graph structure, and computing the Averaged Mixing Matrix (AMM) to describe how the CTQW visit all vertices from a starting vertex. More specifically, we show how this AMM matrix allows us to compute a quantum Shannon entropy for each vertex of a graph. For pairwise graphs, the proposed AERK kernel is defined by computing a reproducing kernel based similarity between the quantum Shannon entropies of their each pair of aligned vertices. The analysis of theoretical properties reveals that the proposed AERK kernel cannot only address the shortcoming of neglecting the structural correspondence information between graphs arising in most existing R-convolution graph kernels, but also overcome the problem of neglecting the structural differences between pairs of aligned vertices arising in existing vertex-based matching kernels. Moreover, unlike existing classical graph kernels that only focus on the global or local structural information of graphs, the proposed AERK kernel can simultaneously capture both global and local structural information through the quantum Shannon entropies, reflecting more precise kernel based similarity measures between pairs of graphs. The above theoretical properties explain the effectiveness of the proposed kernel. The experimental evaluation on standard graph datasets demonstrates that the proposed AERK kernel is able to outperform state-of-the-art graph kernels for graph classification tasks.",

We design FtGAN, an extension to GAN, that can generate test data with varying the intensity (i.e., sum of the neurons) of a channel of a target CNN. We also proposed a channel selection algorithm to find representative channels for testing. To efficiently inspect the target CNN's inference computations, we define unexpectedness score, which estimates how similar the inference computation of the test data is to that of the training data. We evaluated FtGAN with five public datasets and showed that our techniques successfully identify defective channels in five different CNN models.",

Image augmentation has been shown to be an effective technique for improving the performance of a wide variety of image classification and generation tasks. Our framework is based on the Variational Autoencoder architecture and uses a novel approach for augmentation via linear transformation within the latent space itself. We explore losses and augmentation latent geometry to enforce the transformations to be composable and involuntary, thus allowing the transformations to be readily combined or inverted. Finally, we show these properties are better performing with certain pairs of augmentations, but we can transfer the latent space to other sets of augmentations to modify performance, effectively constraining the VAE's bottleneck to preserve the variance of specific augmentations and features of the image which we care about. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach with initial results on the MNIST dataset against both a standard VAE and a Conditional VAE. This latent augmentation method allows for much greater control and geometric interpretability of the latent space, making it a valuable tool for researchers and practitioners in the field.",

        "abstract": "The offline pickup and delivery problem with time windows (PDPTW) is a classical combinatorial optimization problem in the transportation community, which has proven to be very challenging computationally. Due to the complexity of the problem, practical problem instances can be solved only via heuristics, which trade-off solution quality for computational tractability. Among the various heuristics, a common strategy is problem decomposition, that is, the reduction of a large-scale problem into a collection of smaller sub-problems, with spatial and temporal decompositions being two natural approaches. While spatial decomposition has been successful in certain settings, effective temporal decomposition has been challenging due to the difficulty of stitching together the sub-problem solutions across the decomposition boundaries. In this work, we introduce a novel temporal decomposition scheme for solving a class of PDPTWs that have narrow time windows, for which it is able to provide both fast and high-quality solutions. We utilize techniques that have been popularized recently in the context of online dial-a-ride problems along with the general idea of rolling horizon optimization. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to solve offline PDPTWs using such an approach. To show the performance and scalability of our framework, we use the optimization of paratransit services as a motivating example. We compare our results with an offline heuristic algorithm using Google OR-Tools. In smaller problem instances, the baseline approach is as competitive as our framework. However, in larger problem instances, our framework is more scalable and can provide good solutions to problem instances of varying degrees of difficulty, while the baseline algorithm often fails to find a feasible solution within comparable compute times.",

        "abstract": "Developing explainability methods for Natural Language Processing (NLP) models is a challenging task, for two main reasons. First, the high dimensionality of the data (large number of tokens) results in low coverage and in turn small contributions for the top tokens, compared to the overall model performance. Second, owing to their textual nature, the input variables, after appropriate transformations, are effectively binary (presence or absence of a token in an observation), making the input-output relationship difficult to understand. Common NLP interpretation techniques do not have flexibility in resolution, because they usually operate at word-level and provide fully local (message level) or fully global (over all messages) summaries. The goal of this paper is to create more flexible model explainability summaries by segments of observation or clusters of words that are semantically related to each other. In addition, we introduce a root cause analysis method for NLP models, by analyzing representative False Positive and False Negative examples from different segments. At the end, we illustrate, using a Yelp review data set with three segments (Restaurant, Hotel, and Beauty), that exploiting group/cluster structures in words and/or messages can aid in the interpretation of decisions made by NLP models and can be utilized to assess the model's sensitivity or bias towards gender, syntax, and word meanings.",

        "abstract": "Increasing the success rate of a process, i.e. the percentage of cases that end in a positive outcome, is a recurrent process improvement goal. At runtime, there are often certain actions (a.k.a. treatments) that workers may execute to lift the probability that a case ends in a positive outcome. For example, in a loan origination process, a possible treatment is to issue multiple loan offers to increase the probability that the customer takes a loan. Each treatment has a cost. Thus, when defining policies for prescribing treatments to cases, managers need to consider the net gain of the treatments. Also, the effect of a treatment varies over time: treating a case earlier may be more effective than later in a case. This paper presents a prescriptive monitoring method that automates this decision-making task. The method combines causal inference and reinforcement learning to learn treatment policies that maximize the net gain. The method leverages a conformal prediction technique to speed up the convergence of the reinforcement learning mechanism by separating cases that are likely to end up in a positive or negative outcome, from uncertain cases. An evaluation on two real-life datasets shows that the proposed method outperforms a state-of-the-art baseline.",

This is due to their ability to provide logical and interpretable explanations when used for predictions, as well as their ability to generalize to other tasks, domains, and data. While recent methods have been proposed to learn logical rules, the majority of these methods are either restricted by their computational complexity and can not handle the large search space of large-scale KGs, or show poor generalization when exposed to data outside the training set. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end neural model for learning compositional logical rules called NCRL. NCRL detects the best compositional structure of a rule body, and breaks it into small compositions in order to infer the rule head. By recurrently merging compositions in the rule body with a recurrent attention unit, NCRL finally predicts a single rule head. Experimental results show that NCRL learns high-quality rules, as well as being generalizable. Specifically, we show that NCRL is scalable, efficient, and yields state-of-the-art results for knowledge graph completion on large-scale KGs. Moreover, we test NCRL for systematic generalization by learning to reason on small-scale observed graphs and evaluating on larger unseen ones.",

However, this is infeasible due to prohibitive network bandwidth and data labeling costs. Instead, we propose a cooperative data sampling strategy where geo-distributed AVs collaborate to collect a diverse ML training dataset in the cloud. Since the AVs have a shared objective but minimal information about each other's local data distribution and perception model, we can naturally cast cooperative data collection as an $N$-player mathematical game. We show that our cooperative sampling strategy uses minimal information to converge to a centralized oracle policy with complete information about all AVs. Moreover, we theoretically characterize the performance benefits of our game-theoretic strategy compared to greedy sampling. Finally, we experimentally demonstrate that our method outperforms standard benchmarks by up to $21.9\\%$ on 4 perception datasets, including for autonomous driving in adverse weather conditions.

Our setting can ease the usage of foundation/source models as well as prevent the leakage and misuse of foundation/source models. Moreover, we also propose a new training strategy called Bootstrap The Original Latent (BTOL) to fully utilize the foundation/source models. Our strategy consists of a domain adapter and a freeze-and-thaw strategy. We apply our BTOL under BPBA and Black-box UDA settings on three different datasets. Experiments show that our strategy is efficient and robust in various settings without manual augmentations.",

        "abstract": "We present Flow-Guided Density Ratio Learning (FDRL), a simple and scalable approach to generative modeling which builds on the stale (time-independent) approximation of the gradient flow of entropy-regularized f-divergences introduced in DGflow. In DGflow, the intractable time-dependent density ratio is approximated by a stale estimator given by a GAN discriminator. This is sufficient in the case of sample refinement, where the source and target distributions of the flow are close to each other. However, this assumption is invalid for generation and a naive application of the stale estimator fails due to the large chasm between the two distributions. FDRL proposes to train a density ratio estimator such that it learns from progressively improving samples during the training process. We show that this simple method alleviates the density chasm problem, allowing FDRL to generate images of dimensions as high as $128\\times128$, as well as outperform existing gradient flow baselines on quantitative benchmarks. We also show the flexibility of FDRL with two use cases. First, unconditional FDRL can be easily composed with external classifiers to perform class-conditional generation. Second, FDRL can be directly applied to unpaired image-to-image translation with no modifications needed to the framework. Code is publicly available at https://github.com/ajrheng/FDRL.",

Recently, offline RL has been viewed as a sequence modeling problem, where an agent generates a sequence of subsequent actions based on a set of static transition experiences. However, existing approaches that use transformers to attend to all tokens naively can overlook the dependencies between different tokens and limit long-term dependency learning. In this paper, we propose the Graph Decision Transformer (GDT), a novel offline RL approach that models the input sequence into a causal graph to capture potential dependencies between fundamentally different concepts and facilitate temporal and causal relationship learning. GDT uses a graph transformer to process the graph inputs with relation-enhanced mechanisms, and an optional sequence transformer to handle fine-grained spatial information in visual tasks. Our experiments show that GDT matches or surpasses the performance of state-of-the-art offline RL methods on image-based Atari and OpenAI Gym.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we focus on a novel optimization problem in which the objective function is a black-box and can only be evaluated through a ranking oracle. This problem is common in real-world applications, particularly in cases where the function is assessed by human judges. Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) is a prominent example of such an application, which is adopted by the recent works \\cite{ouyang2022training,liu2023languages,chatgpt,bai2022training} to improve the quality of Large Language Models (LLMs) with human guidance. We propose ZO-RankSGD, a first-of-its-kind zeroth-order optimization algorithm, to solve this optimization problem with a theoretical guarantee. Specifically, our algorithm employs a new rank-based random estimator for the descent direction and is proven to converge to a stationary point. ZO-RankSGD can also be directly applied to the policy search problem in reinforcement learning when only a ranking oracle of the episode reward is available. This makes ZO-RankSGD a promising alternative to existing RLHF methods, as it optimizes in an online fashion and thus can work without any pre-collected data. Furthermore, we demonstrate the effectiveness of ZO-RankSGD in a novel application: improving the quality of images generated by a diffusion generative model with human ranking feedback. Throughout experiments, we found that ZO-RankSGD can significantly enhance the detail of generated images with only a few rounds of human feedback. Overall, our work advances the field of zeroth-order optimization by addressing the problem of optimizing functions with only ranking feedback, and offers an effective approach for aligning human and machine intentions in a wide range of domains.

Recently, diffusion models have demonstrated high-quality generative performances in various domains. However, it is unclear how to apply diffusion models to the natural representation of layouts which consists of a mix of discrete (class) and continuous (location, size) attributes. To address the conditioning layout generation problem, we introduce DLT, a joint discrete-continuous diffusion model. DLT is a transformer-based model which has a flexible conditioning mechanism that allows for conditioning on any given subset of all the layout component classes, locations, and sizes. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art generative models on various layout generation datasets with respect to different metrics and conditioning settings. Additionally, we validate the effectiveness of our proposed conditioning mechanism and the joint continuous-diffusion process.

In this work, we investigate the Test-Time Adaptation (TTA), a specific case of UDA where a model is adapted to a target domain without access to source data. We propose a novel approach for the TTA setting based on a loss reweighting strategy that brings robustness against the noise that inevitably affects the pseudo-labels. The classification loss is reweighted based on the reliability of the pseudo-labels that is measured by estimating their uncertainty. Guided by such reweighting strategy, the pseudo-labels are progressively refined by aggregating knowledge from neighbouring samples. Furthermore, a self-supervised contrastive framework is leveraged as a target space regulariser to enhance such knowledge aggregation. A novel negative pairs exclusion strategy is proposed to identify and exclude negative pairs made of samples sharing the same class, even in presence of some noise in the pseudo-labels. Our method outperforms previous methods on three major benchmarks by a large margin. We set the new TTA state-of-the-art on VisDA-C and DomainNet with a performance gain of +1.8\\% on both benchmarks and on PACS with +12.3\\% in the single-source setting and +6.6\\% in\\ multi-target adaptation.

How can we see any hidden patterns, rules, and anomalies? Our answer is to focus on two types of patterns, i.e., ''regimes'' and ''components'', for which we present CubeScope, an efficient and effective method over high-order tensor streams. Specifically, it identifies any sudden discontinuity and recognizes distinct dynamical patterns, ''regimes'' (e.g., weekday/weekend/holiday patterns). In each regime, it also performs multi-way summarization for all attributes (e.g., item, price, brand, and time) and discovers hidden ''components'' representing latent groups (e.g., item/brand groups) and their relationship. Thanks to its concise but effective summarization, CubeScope can also detect the sudden appearance of anomalies and identify the types of anomalies that occur in practice. Our proposed method has the following properties: (a) Effective: it captures dynamical multi-aspect patterns, i.e., regimes and components, and statistically summarizes all the events; (b) General: it is practical for successful application to data compression, pattern discovery, and anomaly detection on various types of tensor streams; (c) Scalable: our algorithm does not depend on the length of the data stream and its dimensionality. Extensive experiments on real datasets demonstrate that CubeScope finds meaningful patterns and anomalies correctly, and consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art methods as regards accuracy and execution speed.",

We first give a theoretical analysis on which factors bring the difficulty of low-resource learning. It then motivate us to propose a challenging benchmark hardBench to better evaluate the learning ability, which covers 11 datasets, including 3 computer vision (CV) datasets and 8 natural language process (NLP) datasets. Experiments on a wide range of models show that neural networks, even pre-trained language models, have sharp performance drops on our benchmark, demonstrating the effectiveness on evaluating the weaknesses of neural networks. On NLP tasks, we surprisingly find that despite better results on traditional low-resource benchmarks, pre-trained networks, does not show performance improvements on our benchmarks.

We also derive conditions for the existence and the computability of a Nash equilibrium between the decision-maker and nature, and we demonstrate numerically that nature's Nash strategy can be viewed as a distribution that is supported on remarkably deceptive adversarial samples. Finally, we identify practically relevant classes of optimal transport-based distributionally robust optimization problems that can be addressed with efficient gradient descent algorithms even if the loss function or the transportation cost function are nonconvex (but not both at the same time).",

In practical scenarios, the relationships between nodes in risk control tasks are bidirectional, e.g., merchants having both revenue and expense behaviors. Graph neural networks designed for undirected graphs usually aggregate discriminative node or edge representations with an attention strategy, but cannot fully exploit the out-degree information when used for the tasks built on directed graph, which leads to the problem of a directional bias. To tackle this problem, we propose a Directed Graph ATtention network called DGAT, which explicitly takes out-degree into attention calculation. In addition to having directional requirements, the same node might have different representations of its input and output, and thus we further propose a dual embedding of DGAT, referred to as DEDGAT. Specifically, DEDGAT assigns in-degree and out-degree representations to each node and uses these two embeddings to calculate the attention weights of in-degree and out-degree nodes, respectively. Experiments performed on the benchmark datasets show that DGAT and DEDGAT obtain better classification performance compared to undirected GAT. Also,the visualization results demonstrate that our methods can fully use both in-degree and out-degree information.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a novel approach to vehicle positioning that operates without reliance on the global navigation satellite system (GNSS). Traditional GNSS approaches are vulnerable to interference in certain environments, rendering them unreliable in situations such as urban canyons, under flyovers, or in low reception areas. This study proposes a vehicle positioning method based on learning the road signature from accelerometer and gyroscope measurements obtained by an inertial measurement unit (IMU) sensor. In our approach, the route is divided into segments, each with a distinct signature that the IMU can detect through the vibrations of a vehicle in response to subtle changes in the road surface. The study presents two different data-driven methods for learning the road segment from IMU measurements. One method is based on convolutional neural networks and the other on ensemble random forest applied to handcrafted features. Additionally, the authors present an algorithm to deduce the position of a vehicle in real-time using the learned road segment. The approach was applied in two positioning tasks: (i) a car along a 6[km] route in a dense urban area; (ii) an e-scooter on a 1[km] route that combined road and pavement surfaces. The mean error between the proposed method's position and the ground truth was approximately 50[m] for the car and 30[m] for the e-scooter. Compared to a solution based on time integration of the IMU measurements, the proposed approach has a mean error of more than 5 times better for e-scooters and 20 times better for cars.",

These approaches often fail to capture the full variation and complexity of interactions between different reef organisms and their habitat. The CUREE platform presented in this paper provides a unique set of capabilities in the form of robot behaviors and perception algorithms to enable scientists to explore different aspects of an ecosystem. Examples of these capabilities include low-altitude visual surveys, soundscape surveys, habitat characterization, and animal following. We demonstrate these capabilities by describing two field deployments on coral reefs in the US Virgin Islands. In the first deployment, we show that CUREE can identify the preferred habitat type of snapping shrimp in a reef through a combination of a visual survey, habitat characterization, and a soundscape survey. In the second deployment, we demonstrate CUREE's ability to follow arbitrary animals by separately following a barracuda and stingray for several minutes each in midwater and benthic environments, respectively.",

        "abstract": "Decision mining enables the discovery of decision rules from event logs or streams, and constitutes an important part of in-depth analysis and optimisation of business processes. So far, decision mining has been merely applied in an ex-post way resulting in a snapshot of decision rules for the given chunk of log data. Online decision mining, by contrast, enables continuous monitoring of decision rule evolution and decision drift. Hence this paper presents an end-to-end approach for the discovery as well as monitoring of decision points and the corresponding decision rules during runtime, bridging the gap between online control flow discovery and decision mining. The approach provides automatic decision support for process-aware information systems with efficient decision drift discovery and monitoring. For monitoring, not only the performance, in terms of accuracy, of decision rules is taken into account, but also the occurrence of data elements and changes in branching frequency. The paper provides two algorithms, which are evaluated on four synthetic and one real-life data set, showing feasibility and applicability of the approach. Overall, the approach fosters the understanding of decisions in business processes and hence contributes to an improved human-process interaction.",

We introduce SF-NeRF, aiming to disentangle those two components with only a few images given, which exploits semantic information without any supervision. The proposed method contains an occlusion filtering module that predicts the transient color and its opacity for each pixel, which enables the NeRF model to solely learn the static scene representation. This filtering module learns the transient phenomena guided by pixel-wise semantic features obtained by a trainable image encoder that can be trained across multiple scenes to learn the prior of transient objects. Furthermore, we present two techniques to prevent ambiguous decomposition and noisy results of the filtering module. We demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art novel view synthesis methods on Phototourism dataset in a few-shot setting.",

We propose epistemic value estimation (EVE): a recipe that is compatible with sequential decision making and with neural network function approximators. It equips agents with a tractable posterior over all their parameters from which epistemic value uncertainty can be computed efficiently.  We use the recipe to derive an epistemic Q-Learning agent and observe competitive performance on a series of benchmarks.

Further, it shows how, under this setting, some root causes can be found directly from the graph and from the time of appearance of anomalies. Finally, it shows, how the rest of the root causes can be found by comparing direct causal effects in the normal and in the anomalous regime. To this end, temporal adaptations of the back-door and the single-door criterions are introduced. Extensive experiments conducted on both simulated and real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.",

Uncertainty is a threat to the dependability of a system, as it limits our ability to assess its dependability properties. We distinguish uncertainties by aleatory (inherent to probabilistic models), epistemic (lack of model parameter knowledge) and ontological (incompleteness of models) in order to determine strategies and methods to cope with them. Analogous to the taxonomy of Laprie et al. we cluster methods into uncertainty prevention (use of elements with well-known behavior, avoiding architectures prone to emergent behavior, restriction of operational design domain, etc.), uncertainty removal (during design time by design of experiment, etc. and after release by field observation, continuous updates, etc.), uncertainty tolerance (use of redundant architectures with diverse uncertainties, uncertainty aware deep learning, etc.) and uncertainty forecasting (estimation of residual uncertainty, etc.).",

Many prior studies have shown that ChatGPT achieves remarkable performance on various NLP tasks in terms of automatic evaluation metrics. However, the ability of ChatGPT to serve as an evaluation metric is still underexplored. Considering assessing the quality of NLG models is an arduous task and previous statistical metrics notoriously show their poor correlation with human judgments, we wonder whether ChatGPT is a good NLG evaluation metric. In this report, we provide a preliminary meta-evaluation on ChatGPT to show its reliability as an NLG metric. In detail, we regard ChatGPT as a human evaluator and give task-specific (e.g., summarization) and aspect-specific (e.g., relevance) instruction to prompt ChatGPT to score the generation of NLG models. We conduct experiments on three widely-used NLG meta-evaluation datasets (including summarization, story generation and data-to-text tasks). Experimental results show that compared with previous automatic metrics, ChatGPT achieves state-of-the-art or competitive correlation with golden human judgments. We hope our preliminary study could prompt the emergence of a general-purposed reliable NLG metric.",

        "abstract": "The main challenge in vision-and-language navigation (VLN) is how to understand natural-language instructions in an unseen environment. The main limitation of conventional VLN algorithms is that if an action is mistaken, the agent fails to follow the instructions or explores unnecessary regions, leading the agent to an irrecoverable path. To tackle this problem, we propose Meta-Explore, a hierarchical navigation method deploying an exploitation policy to correct misled recent actions. We show that an exploitation policy, which moves the agent toward a well-chosen local goal among unvisited but observable states, outperforms a method which moves the agent to a previously visited state. We also highlight the demand for imagining regretful explorations with semantically meaningful clues. The key to our approach is understanding the object placements around the agent in spectral-domain. Specifically, we present a novel visual representation, called scene object spectrum (SOS), which performs category-wise 2D Fourier transform of detected objects. Combining exploitation policy and SOS features, the agent can correct its path by choosing a promising local goal. We evaluate our method in three VLN benchmarks: R2R, SOON, and REVERIE. Meta-Explore outperforms other baselines and shows significant generalization performance. In addition, local goal search using the proposed spectral-domain SOS features significantly improves the success rate by 17.1% and SPL by 20.6% for the SOON benchmark.",

In response to these developments, new paradigms are emerging for training foundation models to interact with other agents and perform long-term reasoning. These paradigms leverage the existence of ever-larger datasets curated for multimodal, multitask, and generalist interaction. Research at the intersection of foundation models and decision making holds tremendous promise for creating powerful new systems that can interact effectively across a diverse range of applications such as dialogue, autonomous driving, healthcare, education, and robotics. In this manuscript, we examine the scope of foundation models for decision making, and provide conceptual tools and technical background for understanding the problem space and exploring new research directions.

Also, discovering new intents and pseudo-labeling of OOD inputs is well known by Intent Discovery. In OOD intent detection part, we make use of a Variational Autoencoder to distinguish between known and unknown intents independent of input data distribution. After that, an unsupervised clustering method is used to discover different unknown intents underlying OOD/OOS inputs. We also apply a non-linear dimensionality reduction on OOD/OOS representations to make distances between representations more meaning full for clustering.

Transition from these simulators, testbeds, and benchmark datasets to more open-world domains poses significant challenges to AI systems, including significant increases in the complexity of the domain and the inclusion of real-world novelties; the open-world environment contains numerous out-of-distribution elements that are not part in the AI systems' training set. Here, we propose a path to a general, domain-independent measure of domain complexity level. We distinguish two aspects of domain complexity: intrinsic and extrinsic. The intrinsic domain complexity is the complexity that exists by itself without any action or interaction from an AI agent performing a task on that domain. This is an agent-independent aspect of the domain complexity. The extrinsic domain complexity is agent- and task-dependent. Intrinsic and extrinsic elements combined capture the overall complexity of the domain. We frame the components that define and impact domain complexity levels in a domain-independent light. Domain-independent measures of complexity could enable quantitative predictions of the difficulty posed to AI systems when transitioning from one testbed or environment to another, when facing out-of-distribution data in open-world tasks, and when navigating the rapidly expanding solution and search spaces encountered in open-world domains.",

Moving beyond code completion to AI-supported software engineering will require an AI system that can, among other things, understand how to avoid code smells, to follow language idioms, and eventually (maybe!) propose rational software designs. In this study, we explore the current limitations of AI-supported code completion tools like Copilot and offer a simple taxonomy for understanding the classification of AI-supported code completion tools in this space. We first perform an exploratory study on Copilot's code suggestions for language idioms and code smells. Copilot does not follow language idioms and avoid code smells in most of our test scenarios. We then conduct additional investigation to determine the current boundaries of AI-supported code completion tools like Copilot by introducing a taxonomy of software abstraction hierarchies where 'basic programming functionality' such as code compilation and syntax checking is at the least abstract level, software architecture analysis and design are at the most abstract level. We conclude by providing a discussion on challenges for future development of AI-supported code completion tools to reach the design level of abstraction in our taxonomy.",

Artificial neural networks come nowhere close: when tasked with learning to classify objects by training on non-repeating video frames in temporal order (online stream learning), models that learn well from shuffled datasets catastrophically forget old knowledge upon learning new stimuli. We propose a new continual learning algorithm, Compositional Replay Using Memory Blocks (CRUMB), which mitigates forgetting by replaying feature maps reconstructed by recombining generic parts. Just as crumbs together form a loaf of bread, we concatenate trainable and re-usable \"memory block\" vectors to compositionally reconstruct feature map tensors in convolutional neural networks. CRUMB stores the indices of memory blocks used to reconstruct new stimuli, enabling replay of specific memories during later tasks. CRUMB's memory blocks are tuned to enhance replay: a single feature map stored, reconstructed, and replayed by CRUMB mitigates forgetting during video stream learning more effectively than an entire image, even though it occupies only 3.6% as much memory. We stress-tested CRUMB alongside 13 competing methods on 5 challenging datasets. To address the limited number of existing online stream learning datasets, we introduce 2 new benchmarks by adapting existing datasets for stream learning. With about 4% of the memory and 20% of the runtime, CRUMB mitigates catastrophic forgetting more effectively than the prior state-of-the-art.

In this work, we introduce an effective theory to model particle-boundary interactions, which leads to our new Boundary Graph Neural Networks (BGNNs) that dynamically modify graph structures to obey boundary conditions. The new BGNNs are tested on complex 3D granular flow processes of hoppers, rotating drums and mixers, which are all standard components of modern industrial machinery but still have complicated geometry. BGNNs are evaluated in terms of computational efficiency as well as prediction accuracy of particle flows and mixing entropies. BGNNs are able to accurately reproduce 3D granular flows within simulation uncertainties over hundreds of thousands of simulation timesteps.

        "abstract": "Biometric systems are vulnerable to Presentation Attacks (PA) performed using various Presentation Attack Instruments (PAIs). Even though there are numerous Presentation Attack Detection (PAD) techniques based on both deep learning and hand-crafted features, the generalization of PAD for unknown PAI is still a challenging problem. In this work, we empirically prove that the initialization of the PAD model is a crucial factor for the generalization, which is rarely discussed in the community. Based on such observation, we proposed a self-supervised learning-based method, denoted as DF-DM. Specifically, DF-DM is based on a global-local view coupled with De-Folding and De-Mixing to derive the task-specific representation for PAD. During De-Folding, the proposed technique will learn region-specific features to represent samples in a local pattern by explicitly minimizing generative loss. While De-Mixing drives detectors to obtain the instance-specific features with global information for more comprehensive representation by minimizing interpolation-based consistency. Extensive experimental results show that the proposed method can achieve significant improvements in terms of both face and fingerprint PAD in more complicated and hybrid datasets when compared with state-of-the-art methods.

        "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2110.03051",
        "abstract": "Popular approaches for quantifying predictive uncertainty in deep neural networks often involve distributions over weights or multiple models, for instance via Markov Chain sampling, ensembling, or Monte Carlo dropout. These techniques usually incur overhead by having to train multiple model instances or do not produce very diverse predictions. This comprehensive and extensive survey aims to familiarize the reader with an alternative class of models based on the concept of Evidential Deep Learning: For unfamiliar data, they aim to admit \"what they don't know\", and fall back onto a prior belief. Furthermore, they allow uncertainty estimation in a single model and forward pass by parameterizing distributions over distributions. This survey recapitulates existing works, focusing on the implementation in a classification setting, before surveying the application of the same paradigm to regression. We also reflect on the strengths and weaknesses compared to other existing methods and provide the most fundamental derivations using a unified notation to aid future research.",

        "abstract": "This paper proposes a method for calibrating control parameters. Examples of such control parameters are gains of PID controllers, weights of a cost function for optimal control, filter coefficients, the sliding surface of a sliding mode controller, or weights of a neural network. Hence, the proposed method can be applied to a wide range of controllers. The method uses a Kalman filter that estimates control parameters, using data of closed-loop system operation. The control parameter calibration is driven by a training objective, which encompasses specifications on the performance of the dynamical system. The performance-driven calibration method tunes the parameters online and robustly, is computationally efficient, has low data storage requirements, and is easy to implement making it appealing for many real-time applications. Simulation results show that the method is able to learn control parameters quickly, is able to tune the parameters to compensate for disturbances, and is robust to noise. A simulation study with the high-fidelity vehicle simulator CarSim shows that the method can calibrate controllers of a complex dynamical system online, which indicates its applicability to a real-world system. We also verify the real-time feasibility on an embedded platform with automotive-grade processors by implementing our method on a dSPACE MicroAutoBox-II rapid prototyping unit.",

However, the power of representation learning has not been fully exploited yet in reinforcement learning (RL), due to i), the trade-off between expressiveness and tractability; and ii), the coupling between exploration and representation learning. In this paper, we first reveal the fact that under some noise assumption in the stochastic control model, we can obtain the linear spectral feature of its corresponding Markov transition operator in closed-form for free. Based on this observation, we propose Spectral Dynamics Embedding (SPEDE), which breaks the trade-off and completes optimistic exploration for representation learning by exploiting the structure of the noise. We provide rigorous theoretical analysis of SPEDE, and demonstrate the practical superior performance over the existing state-of-the-art empirical algorithms on several benchmarks.",

Our insight is that temporal smoothing can create more accurate detection results on unlabeled data, and these smoothed detections can then be used to retrain the detector. We learn to perform this temporal reasoning with a graph neural network, where edges represent the relationship between candidate detections in different time frames. After semi-supervised learning, our method achieves state-of-the-art detection performance on the challenging nuScenes and H3D benchmarks, compared to baselines trained on the same amount of labeled data.

To encourage longsighted robot behaviors, we infer the intentions of dynamic agents by predicting their future trajectories for several timesteps. The predictions are incorporated into a model-free RL framework to prevent the robot from intruding into the intended paths of other agents. We demonstrate that our method enables the robot to achieve good navigation performance and non-invasiveness in challenging crowd navigation scenarios.

In this paper, we propose a new decoding strategy, self-consistency, to replace the naive greedy decoding used in chain-of-thought prompting. It first samples a diverse set of reasoning paths instead of only taking the greedy one, and then selects the most consistent answer by marginalizing out the sampled reasoning paths. Self-consistency leverages the intuition that a complex reasoning problem typically admits multiple different ways of thinking leading to its unique correct answer. Our extensive empirical evaluation shows that self-consistency boosts the performance of chain-of-thought prompting with a striking margin on a range of popular arithmetic and commonsense reasoning benchmarks, including GSM8K (+17.9%), SVAMP (+11.0%), AQuA (+12.2%), StrategyQA (+6.4%) and ARC-challenge (+3.9%).",

        "abstract": "Contrastive learning has shown great promise over annotation scarcity problems in the context of medical image segmentation. Existing approaches typically assume a balanced class distribution for both labeled and unlabeled medical images. However, medical image data in reality is commonly imbalanced (i.e., multi-class label imbalance), which naturally yields blurry contours and usually incorrectly labels rare objects. Moreover, it remains unclear whether all negative samples are equally negative. In this work, we present ACTION, an Anatomical-aware ConTrastive dIstillatiON framework, for semi-supervised medical image segmentation. Specifically, we first develop an iterative contrastive distillation algorithm by softly labeling the negatives rather than binary supervision between positive and negative pairs. We also capture more semantically similar features from the randomly chosen negative set compared to the positives to enforce the diversity of the sampled data. Second, we raise a more important question: Can we really handle imbalanced samples to yield better performance? Hence, the key innovation in ACTION is to learn global semantic relationship across the entire dataset and local anatomical features among the neighbouring pixels with minimal additional memory footprint. During the training, we introduce anatomical contrast by actively sampling a sparse set of hard negative pixels, which can generate smoother segmentation boundaries and more accurate predictions. Extensive experiments across two benchmark datasets and different unlabeled settings show that ACTION significantly outperforms the current state-of-the-art semi-supervised methods.",

We explore this tradeoff by combining pretrained data representations with the cut statistic (Muhlenbach et al., 2004) to select (hopefully) high-quality subsets of the weakly-labeled training data. Subset selection applies to any label model and classifier and is very simple to plug in to existing weak supervision pipelines, requiring just a few lines of code. We show our subset selection method improves the performance of weak supervision for a wide range of label models, classifiers, and datasets. Using less weakly-labeled data improves the accuracy of weak supervision pipelines by up to 19% (absolute) on benchmark tasks.",

        "abstract": "The promise of multimodal models for real-world applications has inspired research in visualizing and understanding their internal mechanics with the end goal of empowering stakeholders to visualize model behavior, perform model debugging, and promote trust in machine learning models. However, modern multimodal models are typically black-box neural networks, which makes it challenging to understand their internal mechanics. How can we visualize the internal modeling of multimodal interactions in these models? Our paper aims to fill this gap by proposing MultiViz, a method for analyzing the behavior of multimodal models by scaffolding the problem of interpretability into 4 stages: (1) unimodal importance: how each modality contributes towards downstream modeling and prediction, (2) cross-modal interactions: how different modalities relate with each other, (3) multimodal representations: how unimodal and cross-modal interactions are represented in decision-level features, and (4) multimodal prediction: how decision-level features are composed to make a prediction. MultiViz is designed to operate on diverse modalities, models, tasks, and research areas. Through experiments on 8 trained models across 6 real-world tasks, we show that the complementary stages in MultiViz together enable users to (1) simulate model predictions, (2) assign interpretable concepts to features, (3) perform error analysis on model misclassifications, and (4) use insights from error analysis to debug models. MultiViz is publicly available, will be regularly updated with new interpretation tools and metrics, and welcomes inputs from the community.",

        "abstract": "Teams are central to human accomplishment. Over the past half-century, psychologists have identified the Big-Five cross-culturally valid personality variables: Neuroticism, Extraversion, Openness, Conscientiousness, and Agreeableness. The first four have shown consistent relationships with team performance. Agreeableness (being harmonious, altruistic, humble, and cooperative), however, has demonstrated a non-significant and highly variable relationship with team performance. We resolve this inconsistency through computational modelling. An agent-based model (ABM) is used to predict the effects of personality traits on teamwork and a genetic algorithm is then used to explore the limits of the ABM in order to discover which traits correlate with best and worst performing teams for a problem with different levels of uncertainty (noise). New dependencies revealed by the exploration are corroborated by analyzing previously-unseen data from one the largest datasets on team performance to date comprising 3,698 individuals in 593 teams working on more than 5,000 group tasks with and without uncertainty, collected over a 10-year period. Our finding is that the dependency between team performance and Agreeableness is moderated by task uncertainty. Combining evolutionary computation with ABMs in this way provides a new methodology for the scientific investigation of teamwork, making new predictions, and improving our understanding of human behaviors. Our results confirm the potential usefulness of computer modelling for developing theory, as well as shedding light on the future of teams as work environments are becoming increasingly fluid and uncertain.",

Every evacuation plan has two essential components: routing and scheduling. However, joint optimization of these two components with objectives such as minimizing average evacuation time or evacuation completion time, is a computationally hard problem. To approach it, we present MIP-LNS, a scalable optimization method that utilizes heuristic search with mathematical optimization and can optimize a variety of objective functions. We also present the method MIP-LNS-SIM, where we further combine an agent-based model together with MIP-LNS to more accurately estimate the delay on roads due to congestion. We use real-world road network and population data from Harris County in Houston, Texas, and apply our methods to find evacuation routes and schedule for the area. We show that, within a given time limit, MIP-LNS finds better solutions than existing methods in terms of average evacuation time, evacuation completion time and optimality guarantee of the solutions. We also perform experiments with MIP-LNS-SIM to show its efficacy in estimating delays in the road network due to congestion by using an agent based model. Our results show that MIP-LNS-SIM can find efficient evacuation plans, and at the same time provide an estimate of the evacuation completion time for the given plan with a small percent error.",

In this regard, simulators provide a cheap and abundant source. For successful sim-to-real transfer, exhaustively engineered approaches such as system identification, dynamics randomization, and domain adaptation are generally employed. As an alternative, we investigate a simple strategy of random force injection (RFI) to perturb system dynamics during training. We show that the application of random forces enables us to emulate dynamics randomization. This allows us to obtain locomotion policies that are robust to variations in system dynamics. We further extend RFI, referred to as extended random force injection (ERFI), by introducing an episodic actuation offset. We demonstrate that ERFI provides additional robustness for variations in system mass offering on average a 53% improved performance over RFI. We also show that ERFI is sufficient to perform a successful sim-to-real transfer on two different quadrupedal platforms, ANYmal C and Unitree A1, even for perceptive locomotion over uneven terrain in outdoor environments.",

The key to our approach is leveraging human demonstration data to generate trajectories that synergize well with humans during test time in a receding horizon fashion. Comparison between a baseline, sampling-based planner RRT (Rapidly-exploring Random Trees) and the VRNN planner in centralized planning shows that the VRNN generates motion more similar to the distribution of human-human demonstrations than the RRT. Results in a human-in-the-loop user study show that the VRNN planner outperforms decentralized RRT on task-related metrics, and is significantly more likely to be perceived as human than the RRT planner.

Ideally, the distribution of the data points in the latent space should depend only on the task, the data, the loss, and other architecture-specific constraints. However, factors such as the random weights initialization, training hyperparameters, or other sources of randomness in the training phase may induce incoherent latent spaces that hinder any form of reuse. Nevertheless, we empirically observe that, under the same data and modeling choices, the angles between the encodings within distinct latent spaces do not change. In this work, we propose the latent similarity between each sample and a fixed set of anchors as an alternative data representation, demonstrating that it can enforce the desired invariances without any additional training. We show how neural architectures can leverage these relative representations to guarantee, in practice, invariance to latent isometries and rescalings, effectively enabling latent space communication: from zero-shot model stitching to latent space comparison between diverse settings.

Given the inherent cost and scarcity of in-domain, task-specific robot data, learning from large, diverse, offline human videos has emerged as a promising path towards acquiring a generally useful visual representation for control; however, how these human videos can be used for general-purpose reward learning remains an open question. We introduce $\\textbf{V}$alue-$\\textbf{I}$mplicit $\\textbf{P}$re-training (VIP), a self-supervised pre-trained visual representation capable of generating dense and smooth reward functions for unseen robotic tasks. VIP casts representation learning from human videos as an offline goal-conditioned reinforcement learning problem and derives a self-supervised dual goal-conditioned value-function objective that does not depend on actions, enabling pre-training on unlabeled human videos. Theoretically, VIP can be understood as a novel implicit time contrastive objective that generates a temporally smooth embedding, enabling the value function to be implicitly defined via the embedding distance, which can then be used to construct the reward for any goal-image specified downstream task. Trained on large-scale Ego4D human videos and without any fine-tuning on in-domain, task-specific data, VIP's frozen representation can provide dense visual reward for an extensive set of simulated and $\\textbf{real-robot}$ tasks, enabling diverse reward-based visual control methods and significantly outperforming all prior pre-trained representations.

Recently, Unsupervised Environment Design (UED) emerged as a new paradigm for zero-shot generalization by simultaneously learning a task distribution and agent policies on the generated tasks. This is a non-stationary process where the task distribution evolves along with agent policies; creating an instability over time. While past works demonstrated the potential of such approaches, sampling effectively from the task space remains an open challenge, bottlenecking these approaches. To this end, we introduce CLUTR: a novel unsupervised curriculum learning algorithm that decouples task representation and curriculum learning into a two-stage optimization. It first trains a recurrent variational autoencoder on randomly generated tasks to learn a latent task manifold. Next, a teacher agent creates a curriculum by maximizing a minimax REGRET-based objective on a set of latent tasks sampled from this manifold. Using the fixed-pretrained task manifold, we show that CLUTR successfully overcomes the non-stationarity problem and improves stability. Our experimental results show CLUTR outperforms PAIRED, a principled and popular UED method, in the challenging CarRacing and navigation environments: achieving 10.6X and 45\\% improvement in zero-shot generalization, respectively.

We argue that encoding different forms of physical prior into model architectures, optimizers, inference algorithms, and significant domain-specific applications like inverse engineering design and robotic control is far from being fully explored in the field of physics-informed machine learning. We believe that the interdisciplinary research of physics-informed machine learning will significantly propel research progress, foster the creation of more effective machine learning models, and also offer invaluable assistance in addressing long-standing problems in related disciplines.",

        "abstract": "Observing a human demonstrator manipulate objects provides a rich, scalable and inexpensive source of data for learning robotic policies. However, transferring skills from human videos to a robotic manipulator poses several challenges, not least a difference in action and observation spaces. In this work, we use unlabeled videos of humans solving a wide range of manipulation tasks to learn a task-agnostic reward function for robotic manipulation policies. Thanks to the diversity of this training data, the learned reward function sufficiently generalizes to image observations from a previously unseen robot embodiment and environment to provide a meaningful prior for directed exploration in reinforcement learning. We propose two methods for scoring states relative to a goal image: through direct temporal regression, and through distances in an embedding space obtained with time-contrastive learning. By conditioning the function on a goal image, we are able to reuse one model across a variety of tasks. Unlike prior work on leveraging human videos to teach robots, our method, Human Offline Learned Distances (HOLD) requires neither a priori data from the robot environment, nor a set of task-specific human demonstrations, nor a predefined notion of correspondence across morphologies, yet it is able to accelerate training of several manipulation tasks on a simulated robot arm compared to using only a sparse reward obtained from task completion.",

        "abstract": "Blockchains with smart contracts are distributed ledger systems that achieve block-state consistency among distributed nodes by only allowing deterministic operations of smart contracts. However, the power of smart contracts is enabled by interacting with stochastic off-chain data, which in turn opens the possibility to undermine the block-state consistency. To address this issue, an oracle smart contract is used to provide a single consistent source of external data; but, simultaneously, this introduces a single point of failure, which is called the oracle problem. To address the oracle problem, we propose an adaptive conformal consensus (ACon$^2$) algorithm that derives a consensus set of data from multiple oracle contracts via the recent advance in online uncertainty quantification learning. Interesting, the consensus set provides a desired correctness guarantee under distribution shift and Byzantine adversaries. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed algorithm on two price datasets and an Ethereum case study. In particular, the Solidity implementation of the proposed algorithm shows the potential practicality of the proposed algorithm, implying that online machine learning algorithms are applicable to address security issues in blockchains.",

        "abstract": "Learning semantic-rich representations from raw unlabeled time series data is critical for downstream tasks such as classification and forecasting. Contrastive learning has recently shown its promising representation learning capability in the absence of expert annotations. However, existing contrastive approaches generally treat each instance independently, which leads to false negative pairs that share the same semantics. To tackle this problem, we propose MHCCL, a Masked Hierarchical Cluster-wise Contrastive Learning model, which exploits semantic information obtained from the hierarchical structure consisting of multiple latent partitions for multivariate time series. Motivated by the observation that fine-grained clustering preserves higher purity while coarse-grained one reflects higher-level semantics, we propose a novel downward masking strategy to filter out fake negatives and supplement positives by incorporating the multi-granularity information from the clustering hierarchy. In addition, a novel upward masking strategy is designed in MHCCL to remove outliers of clusters at each partition to refine prototypes, which helps speed up the hierarchical clustering process and improves the clustering quality. We conduct experimental evaluations on seven widely-used multivariate time series datasets. The results demonstrate the superiority of MHCCL over the state-of-the-art approaches for unsupervised time series representation learning.",

In this paper, we propose a new machine learning (ML) assisted unrolling approach, called LAAU (Learning-Assisted Algorithm Unrolling), which unrolls the online decision pipeline and leverages an ML model for updating the Lagrangian multiplier online. For efficient training via backpropagation, we derive gradients of the decision pipeline over time. We also provide the average cost bounds for two cases when training data is available offline and collected online, respectively.

Safety issues arise in modern LfD techniques, e.g., Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL), just as they do for RL; yet, safe learning in LfD has received little attention. In the context of agile robots, safety is especially vital due to the possibility of robot-environment collision, robot-human collision, and damage to the robot. In this paper, we propose a safe IRL framework, CBFIRL, that leverages the Control Barrier Function (CBF) to enhance the safety of the IRL policy. The core idea of CBFIRL is to combine a loss function inspired by CBF requirements with the objective in an IRL method, both of which are jointly optimized via gradient descent. In the experiments, we show our framework performs safer compared to IRL methods without CBF, that is $\\sim15\\%$ and $\\sim20\\%$ improvement for two levels of difficulty of a 2D racecar domain and $\\sim 50\\%$ improvement for a 3D drone domain.",

First, we find that model capacity, crop size, multi-scale testing, and prediction correctness have impact on calibration. Among them, prediction correctness, especially misprediction, is more important to miscalibration due to over-confidence. Next, we propose a simple, unifying, and effective approach, namely selective scaling, by separating correct/incorrect prediction for scaling and more focusing on misprediction logit smoothing. Then, we study popular existing calibration methods and compare them with selective scaling on semantic segmentation calibration. We conduct extensive experiments with a variety of benchmarks on both in-domain and domain-shift calibration, and show that selective scaling consistently outperforms other methods.",

To mitigate the traffic pressure, architectures with in-network storage are proposed to cache popular content at nodes in close proximity to users to shorten the backhaul links. Meanwhile, the reduction of transmission distance also contributes to the energy saving. However, due to limited storage, only a fraction of the content can be cached, while caching the most popular content is cost-effective. Correspondingly, it becomes essential to devise an effective popularity prediction method. In this regard, existing efforts adopt dynamic graph neural network (DGNN) models, but it remains challenging to tackle sparse datasets. In this paper, we first propose a reformative temporal graph network, which is named STGN, that utilizes extra semantic messages to enhance the temporal and structural learning of a DGNN model, since the consideration of semantics can help establish implicit paths within the sparse interaction graph and hence improve the prediction performance. Furthermore, we propose a user-specific attention mechanism to fine-grainedly aggregate various semantics. Finally, extensive simulations verify the superiority of our STGN models and demonstrate their high potential in energy-saving.",

        "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) models are increasingly used in the medical domain. However, as medical data is highly sensitive, special precautions to ensure its protection are required. The gold standard for privacy preservation is the introduction of differential privacy (DP) to model training. Prior work indicates that DP has negative implications on model accuracy and fairness, which are unacceptable in medicine and represent a main barrier to the widespread use of privacy-preserving techniques. In this work, we evaluated the effect of privacy-preserving training of AI models for chest radiograph diagnosis regarding accuracy and fairness compared to non-private training. For this, we used a large dataset (N=193,311) of high quality clinical chest radiographs, which were retrospectively collected and manually labeled by experienced radiologists. We then compared non-private deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and privacy-preserving (DP) models with respect to privacy-utility trade-offs measured as area under the receiver-operator-characteristic curve (AUROC), and privacy-fairness trade-offs, measured as Pearson's r or Statistical Parity Difference. We found that the non-private CNNs achieved an average AUROC score of 0.90 +- 0.04 over all labels, whereas the DP CNNs with a privacy budget of epsilon=7.89 resulted in an AUROC of 0.87 +- 0.04, i.e., a mere 2.6% performance decrease compared to non-private training. Furthermore, we found the privacy-preserving training not to amplify discrimination against age, sex or co-morbidity. Our study shows that -- under the challenging realistic circumstances of a real-life clinical dataset -- the privacy-preserving training of diagnostic deep learning models is possible with excellent diagnostic accuracy and fairness.",

Latest work in this field performs 3D object detection by leveraging multi-view images as an input and iteratively enhancing object queries (object proposals) by cross-attending multi-view features. However, individual backbone features are not updated with multi-view features and it stays as a mere collection of the output of the single-image backbone network. Therefore we propose 3M3D: A Multi-view, Multi-path, Multi-representation for 3D Object Detection where we update both multi-view features and query features to enhance the representation of the scene in both fine panoramic view and coarse global view. Firstly, we update multi-view features by multi-view axis self-attention. It will incorporate panoramic information in the multi-view features and enhance understanding of the global scene. Secondly, we update multi-view features by self-attention of the ROI (Region of Interest) windows which encodes local finer details in the features. It will help exchange the information not only along the multi-view axis but also along the other spatial dimension. Lastly, we leverage the fact of multi-representation of queries in different domains to further boost the performance. Here we use sparse floating queries along with dense BEV (Bird's Eye View) queries, which are later post-processed to filter duplicate detections.

Very large language models are good at leveraging public data on standard problems but once you want to tackle more specific complex questions or problems you may need specific architecture, knowledge, skills, tasks, methods, sensitive data, performance, human approval and versatile feedback... This survey extends findings from the robust community edited research papers BIG, BLOOM and HELM which open source, benchmark and analyze limits and challenges of large language models in terms of tasks complexity and strict evaluation on accuracy (e.g. fairness, robustness, toxicity, ...). It identifies the key elements used with Large Language Models (LLM) to solve complex questions or problems.

We discuss some challenges associated with complex QA, including domain adaptation, decomposition and efficient multi-step QA, long form QA, non-factoid QA, safety and multi-sensitivity data protection, multimodal search, hallucinations, QA explainability and truthfulness, time dimension. Therefore we review current solutions and promising strategies, using elements such as hybrid LLM architectures, human-in-the-loop reinforcement learning, prompting adaptation, neuro-symbolic and structured knowledge grounding, program synthesis, and others.

Specifically, we first devise unbiased prompts by randomly permuting options in MBTI questions and adopt the average testing result to encourage more impartial answer generation. Then, we propose to replace the subject in question statements to enable flexible queries and assessments on different subjects from LLMs. Finally, we re-formulate the question instructions in a manner of correctness evaluation to facilitate LLMs to generate clearer responses. The proposed framework enables LLMs to flexibly assess personalities of different groups of people. We further propose three evaluation metrics to measure the consistency, robustness, and fairness of assessment results from state-of-the-art LLMs including ChatGPT and InstructGPT.

Microscopic analyses revealed its essential role in male and female fertility, trichomes and root hairs development, proper chloroplast function, and in apical meristem maintenance and differentiation. Comparative transcriptome and proteome analyses also revealed a role of the protein in a multitude of cellular processes. Particularly, the auxin responsive pathway was specifically down-regulated in the hsp90.7-1 mutant seedlings. We measured a much-reduced auxin content in both root and shoot tissues.

Measuring and characterizing genetic diversity is key to understanding adaptive potential and developing strategies to mitigate negative consequences arising from climate change. In the area of forest genetic diversity, genetic divergence caused by large-scale changes at the chromosomal level have been largely understudied. In this study, we used the RNA-seq data of twenty co-occurring forest trees species from genera including Acer, Alnus, Amelanchier, Betula, Cornus, Corylus, Dirca, Fraxinus, Ostrya, Populus, Prunus, Quercus, Ribes, Tilia, and Ulmus sampled from Upper Peninsula of Michigan. These data were used to infer the origin and maintenance of gene family variation, species divergence time, as well as gene family expansion and contraction. We identified a signal of common whole genome duplication events shared by core eudicots, and a signal of recent duplication events specific to particular species. We also found rapid evolution, namely fast expansion or fast contraction of gene families, in plant-pathogen interaction genes amongst the diploid species studied. Finally, the results lay the foundation for further research on the genetic diversity and adaptive capacity of forest trees, which will inform forest management and conservation policies.",

Using bimolecular fluorescence complementation, in vitro pull-down, yeast two-hybrid, and in vivo co-immunoprecipitation assays, we found that VirE2 binds directly to the cargo binding domains of several myosin VIII family members, and to myosin XI-K. We observed reduced susceptibility of several Arabidopsis actin mutants and a myosin VIII-1/2/a/b mutant to transformation. Expression of cargo binding domains of myosin VIII-1, VIII-2, VIII-A, or VIII-B inhibits Arabidopsis root transformation. However, no myosin VIII protein contributes to the intracellular trafficking of VirE2. Expression of myosin VIII-2, -A, -B, but not VIII-1, cDNAs in the myosin VIII-1/2/a/b mutant partially restored transformation. Fluorescently-tagged VirE2 relocalized from the cellular periphery into the cytoplasm after delivery of T-strands from Agrobacterium. Mutation of myosin XI-k and expression of the myosin XI-K cargo binding domain had no effect on transformation but blocked VirE2 movement. Myosin VIII proteins may facilitate VirE2 tethering to the plasma membrane from which they bind incoming T-strands. Myosin XI-K is important for VirE2 movement through the cytoplasm.",

        "abstract": "Reconstructing the biogeographical history and timing of the diversification of temperate forests is essential for understanding their history and resolving uncertainties about how flowering plants emerged from their deep tropical origins to dominate in today's freezing terrestrial environments. The angiosperm order Fagales, comprising iconic components of temperate forests worldwide with an extensive fossil record, are an excellent plant system in which to apply a fossil-aware paradigm, such as the fossilized birth-death (FBD) process, for investigating the macroevolution of temperate forest biomes. Here, we improve upon previous efforts to resolve phylogeny and incorporate fossils in Fagales using low-copy nuclear loci and an expanded morphological matrix to reevaluate the Fagales fossil record and: (1) infer the phylogenetic relationships and the time of origin of the clade using the FBD model as implemented in RevBayes, (2) provide a framework for evaluating the climatic and biogeographic history of Fagales, and (3) investigate how the inclusion of fossils via the FBD method influences ancestral reconstruction and diversification estimation. The phylogenetic relationships we recovered are conventional except for the position of Nothofagaceae, while our inferred ages support older timelines than previously proposed, with a mid-Cretaceous date for the most recent common ancestor of the order. Biogeographical analysis shows an origin of Fagales consistent with an ancestral circumboreal temperate distribution corroborated by ancestral niche reconstructions. While distributions today largely reflect the general conservatism of temperate forests, we identified two episodes of high diversification, one at the mid-Cretaceous origin of the clade and the other continuing from the Miocene to the present. Removing fossil taxa from the tree reveals a different story, shifting the origin of extant families from North America to East Asia, reflecting refugial distributions in this biodiversity \"museum\" and implying a general bias towards low extinction areas in biogeographic reconstruction. Likewise, without fossil data, diversification estimates were higher and unable to detect an early diversification burst. Based on our analyses, we close with recommendations regarding the interpretation of estimates of diversification and ancestral state reconstruction using phylogenetic trees with only extant species as tips.",

        "abstract": "Over the past three decades, researchers have isolated plant mutants that display constitutively activated defense responses in the absence of pathogen infection. These mutants are called autoimmune mutants and are typically dwarf and/or bearing chlorotic/necrotic lesions. From a genetic screen for Arabidopsis genes involved in maintaining a normal leaf microbiota, we identified TIP GROWTH DEFECTIVE 1 (TIP1), which encodes a S-acyltransferase, as a key player in guarding leaves against abnormal microbiota level and composition under high humidity conditions. The tip1 mutant has several characteristic phenotypes of classical autoimmune mutants, including a dwarf stature, displaying lesions, and having a high basal level of defense gene expression. Gnotobiotic experiments revealed that the autoimmune phenotypes of the tip1 mutant are largely dependent on the presence of microbiota as axenic tip1 plants have markedly reduced autoimmune phenotypes. We found that the microbiota dependency of autoimmune phenotypes is shared by several \"lesion mimic\"-type autoimmune mutants in Arabidopsis. Interestingly, autoimmune phenotypes caused by mutations in NLR genes do not require the presence of microbiota and can even be partially alleviated by microbiota. Our results therefore suggest the existence of two classes of autoimmunity (microbiota-dependent vs. microbiota-independent) in plants. The observed interplay between autoimmunity and microbiota in the lesion mimic class of autoimmunity is reminiscent of the interactions between autoimmunity and dysbiosis in the animal kingdom.",

Exploring plant traits and how they respond to drought has the potential to improve understanding of drought tolerance and inform breeding efforts to develop more drought tolerant plants. Given their importance in plant-water relations, we explored variation and plasticity in leaf traits in response to water limitation in cultivated sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.). A set of four sunflower genotypes was grown under four different levels of water availability and leaf vein and stomatal traits were measured along with total biomass (as an indicator of performance), leaf mass per area (LMA), chlorophyll content, and various mass fraction traits related to resource allocation (e.g., leaf, root, and stem mass fraction). Traits exhibited numerous bivariate correlations within treatments that generally followed expectations based on the literature. For example, stomatal size and density were negatively correlated while stomatal density and vein length per area (VLA) were positively correlated. Most traits exhibited substantial plasticity, as evidenced by significant shifts in trait values across environments and multivariate analyses revealed differentiation in trait space across treatment levels. This included an overall reduction in growth/productivity in response to stress, accompanied by a shift in traits relating to gas exchange and hydraulics including stomatal and vein density (increased), stomatal size (decreased), and theoretical gsmax (increased). We found that variation in performance across treatments (estimated as total biomass) can be largely explained by a small number of putatively size-independent traits (i.e., VLA, stomatal length and density and LMA; R2 = 0.74). Moreover, on average, more extreme changes in VLA were associated with more extreme decreases in performance across environments. A small number of leaf traits can predict plant performance, with plasticity in VLA being the best predictor of changes in productivity.",

Recent findings indicate that there may be significant intra-specific variation in traits such as vein density in C4 plants but to use such natural variation for trait-mapping, rapid phenotyping would be required. Here we report a high-throughput method to quantify vein density that leverages the bundle sheath specific accumulation of starch found in C4 species. Starch staining allowed high-contrast images to be acquired that permitted image analysis using a MATLAB-based program. The method works for the dicotyledon Gynandropsis gynandra where significant variation in vein density was detected between natural accessions, and the monocotyledon Zea mays where no variation was apparent in the genotypically diverse lines assessed.

Triple as well as quintuple mutants accumulated 3-4 times less nicotine than the respective control lines. The availability of lines without functional BBLs allowed us to probe their catalytic role in nicotine biosynthesis, which has remained obscure.

In this study, a panel of 223 Chinese Upland cotton accessions was evaluated for FOV4 resistance based on seedling mortality rate (MR) and stem and root vascular discoloration (SVD and RVD). SNP markers were developed based on targeted genome sequencing using AgriPlex Genomics. The chromosome region at 2.130-2.292 Mb on D03 was significantly correlated with both SVD and RVD but not with MR.

Genomic selection and neural networks, particularly deep learning, have been developed to predict complex traits from dense genotypic data. Autoencoders, a neural network model to extract features from images in an unsupervised manner, has proven to be useful for plant phenotyping. This study introduces an autoencoder framework, GenoDrawing, for predicting and retrieving apple images from a low-depth single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array, potentially useful in predicting traits that are difficult to define. GenoDrawing demonstrated proficiency in its task while using a small dataset of shape-related SNPs, and multiple experiments were conducted to evaluate the impact of SNP selection and shape relation. Results indicated that the correct relationship of SNPs with visual traits had a significant impact on the generated images, consistent with biological interpretation. While using significant SNPs is crucial, incorporating additional, unrelated SNPs results in performance degradation for simple NN architectures that cannot easily identify the most important inputs. The proposed GenoDrawing method is a practical framework for exploring genomic prediction in fruit tree phenotyping, particularly beneficial for small to medium breeding companies to predict economically significant heritable traits. Although GenoDrawing has limitations, it sets the groundwork for future research in image prediction from genomic markers. Future studies should focus on using stronger models for image reproduction, SNP information extraction, and improved dataset balance in terms of shape for more precise outcomes.",

The development of a unique form of gliding motility in raphid diatoms was a key molecular adaptation that contributed to their evolutionary success. Gliding motility is hypothesized to be driven by an intracellular actin-myosin motor and requires the secretion of polysaccharide- and protein-based adhesive materials. To date, the structure-function correlation between diatom adhesives utilized for gliding and their relationship to the extracellular matrix that constitutes the diatom biofilm is unknown. Proteomics analysis of the adhesive material from Craspedostauros australis revealed eight novel, diatom-specific proteins. Four of them constitute a new family of proteins, named Trailins, which contain an enigmatic domain termed Choice-of-Anchor-A (CAA). Immunostaining demonstrated that Trailins are only present in the adhesive trails required to generate traction on native substrata, but are absent from the extracellular matrix of biofilms. Phylogenetic analysis and Protein 3D structure prediction suggests that the CAA-domains in Trailins were obtained from bacteria by horizontal gene transfer, and exhibit a striking structural similarity to ice-binding proteins.

We characterize the transcriptomic effect of expressing IPD3 in Arabidopsis with and without exposure to the AM fungus (AMF) Rhizophagus irregularis, and compare these results to the AM model Lotus japonicus and its ipd3 knockout mutant cyclops-4. Despite its long history as a non-AM species, restoring IPD3 in the form of its constitutively active DNA-binding domain to Arabidopsis altered expression of specific gene networks. Surprisingly, the effect of expressing IPD3 in Arabidopsis and knocking it out in Lotus was strongest in plants not exposed to AMF, which is revealed to be due to changes in IPD3 genotype causing a transcriptional state which partially mimics AMF exposure in non-inoculated plants. Our results indicate that despite the long interval since loss of AM and IPD3 in Arabidopsis, molecular connections to symbiosis machinery remain in place in this nonAM species, with implications for both basic science and the prospect of engineering this trait for agriculture.",

However, little is known about the genetic and molecular regulation underlying its development. Unraveling such regulation would pave the way for biotechnology approaches aimed at enhancing cassava productivity. Anatomical studies indicate that SR development relies on the massive accumulation of xylem parenchyma, a cell-type derived from the vascular cambium. The C3HDZ family of transcription factors regulate cambial cells proliferation and xylem differentiation in Arabidopsis and other species. We thus aimed at identifying C3HDZ proteins in cassava and determining whether any of them shows preferential activity in the SR cambium and/or xylem. Using phylogeny and synteny studies, we identified eight C3HDZ proteins in cassava, namely MeCH3DZ1-8. We observed that the expression of MeC3HDZ1 in SR cambium and xylem is higher than that of any other MeC3HDZ gene in any of the SR vascular tissues or any of the other vegetative organs. We established an in-silico pipeline which revealed the existence of a number of theoretical C3HDZ targets displaying significant preferential expression in the SR. Subsequent Y1H analyses proved that MeC3HDZ1 can bind canonical C3HDZ binding sites in the promoters of these targets. Transactivation assays demonstrated that MeC3HDZ1 can regulate the expression of genes downstream of promoters harboring such binding sites, thereby demonstrating that MeC3HDZ1 is a C3HDZ transcription factor which constitutes a strong candidate for future biotechnology strategies directed at increasing cassava productivity.",

        "abstract": "Euterpe edulis Martius is an endangered species of the Atlantic Forest, whose fruits have high antioxidant potential, and propagated exclusively by seeds. The present study assessed the ability of different auxin inducers and picloram analogs to trigger somatic embryogenesis in E. edulis. Immature seeds were harvested, and their zygotic embryos were excised and grown in MS culture medium supplemented with 2,4-D dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) or picloram at 150, 300, 450, 600 M. The activity of picloram analogs triclopyr and clopyralid was evaluated in semisolid MS medium. At maturation and germination, picloram-derived calli and somatic embryos isolated from triclopyr-grown cultures were first transferred to pre-maturation medium and, after 30 days, to basal MS or MS medium supplemented with either 5 M abscisic acid or 0.53 M 1-naphthaleneacetic acid plus 12.3 M 2-isopentenyladenine. Finally, somatic embryos with root protrusions were transferred to MS medium devoid of sucrose for 30 days and then acclimatized ex vitro. Scanning, transmission, and atomic force microscopy revealed that picloram was superior to 2,4-D but less effective than triclopyr (100 M) in inducing embryogenesis. Maturation and germination of somatic embryos in E. edulis can be maximized by 5 M abscisic acid, and selecting calli via atomic force microscopy.",

Tumors result from the de novo cell division of highly developed bundle sheath and subsequent cell enlargement. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying tumorigenesis are still largely unknown. Here, we characterize the U. maydis effector Sts2 (Small tumor on seedlings 2), which promotes the division of hyperplasia tumor cells. Upon infection, Sts2 is translocated into the maize cell nucleus, where it acts as a transcriptional activator, and the transactivation activity is crucial for its virulence function. Sts2 interacts with ZmNECAP1, a yet undescribed plant transcriptional activator, and it activates the expression of several leaf developmental regulators to potentiate tumor formation. Contrary, fusion of a suppressive SRDX-motif to Sts2 causes dominant negative inhibition of tumor formation, underpinning the central role of Sts2 for tumorigenesis. Our results not only disclose the virulence mechanism of a tumorigenic effector, but also reveal the essential role of leaf developmental regulators in pathogen-induced tumor formation.",

The extent of OA and its relation to stomatal behavior, leaf roll, and kernel development under periods of drought remain elusive for CWRS. For several commercially used Canadian cultivars (Superb, Stettler, AAC Viewfield), OA was not found to be a mechanism contributing to drought tolerance. In contrast, we found that sustained kernel weight during periods of relatively low soil water content was linked to tight stomatal behavior (i.e., efficient transition from onset to full stomatal closure) and early leaf roll (i.e., reductions in flag leaf width). Moreover, leaf hydration status ({Theta}RWC) marked the onset of drought-induced losses in kernel weight in all three cultivars. In conclusion, HRSW lacks OA but leaf stomatal behavior and leaf rolling aid in securing leaf hydration status and kernel weight under drought.",

Using precision-phenotyping lysimeters, we imposed pre-flowering drought on four barley varieties (Arvo, Golden Promise, Hankkija 673 and Morex) and followed their physiological responses. For Golden Promise, we carried out RNA-seq on leaf transcripts before and during drought, and during recovery, also examining retrotransposon BARE1 expression. Transcriptional data were subjected to network analysis. The varieties differed by their critical SWC, Hankkija 673 responding at the highest and Golden Promise at the lowest. Pathways connected to drought and salinity response were strongly upregulated during drought; pathways connected to growth and development were strongly downregulated. During recovery, growth and development pathways were upregulated; altogether 117 networked genes involved in ubiquitin-mediated autophagy were downregulated. The differential response to SWC suggests adaptation to distinct rainfall patterns. We identified several strongly differentially expressed genes not earlier associated with drought response in barley. BARE1 transcription is strongly transcriptionally upregulated by drought and downregulated during recovery unequally between the investigated cultivars. The downregulation of networked autophagy genes suggests a role for autophagy in drought response; its importance to resilience should be further investigated.",

Results show that a second HS induces changes in coding and noncoding RNA expression and alternative splicing and that DNA demethylation is responsible for mediating differential gene expression. We identified a long noncoding RNA regulatory network and provided evidence that lncRNAs positively regulate gene expression, while miRNAs are implicated in alternative splicing events. We reconstructed the ancestral heat memory network of flowering plants by comparing the dynamic responses of Arabidopsis thaliana and Brachypodium distachyon.

MtNCC1 is a nodule-specific Cu+-chaperone encoded in the Medicago truncatula genome, with a N-terminus Atx1-like domain that can bind Cu+ with picomolar affinities. This gene is expressed primarily from the late infection zone to the early fixation zone, and is located in the cytosol, associated to plasma and symbiosome membranes, and within nuclei. Consistent with its key role in nitrogen fixation, ncc1 mutants have a severe reduction of nitrogenase activity, and a 50% reduction in copper-dependent cytochrome c oxidase activity. A subset of the copper-proteome is also affected in the mutant nodules. Many of these proteins can be pulled-down when using a Cu+-loaded N-terminal MtNCC1 moiety as a bait, indicating a role in nodule copper homeostasis and in copper-dependent physiological processes.

The transcription factor GLK1 functions at the interface between these pathways, and receives input from the biogenic-signaling integrator GUN1. BBX14 was previously identified, together with GLK1, in a core module that mediates the response to high light levels and biogenic signaling. To gain insight into the function of BBX14, we generated BBX14 overexpressors and CRISPR/Cas-mediated bbx14 mutant plants, conducted high-light, RT-qPCR and ChIP-Seq experiments, measured photosynthetic parameters, chlorophyll contents and growth rates, and analyzed alterations in transcriptomics. We found that, although overexpression of BBX14 is deleterious under normal growth conditions, BBX14 is needed to acclimate plants to high light stress. BBX14 is a direct target of GLK1, and RNA-Seq analysis suggests that BBX14 is involved in the circadian clock. Knockout of BBX14 results in a long-hypocotyl phenotype that depends on a retrograde signal, and BBX14 expression during biogenic signaling requires GUN1. Finally, we clarify the role of BBX14 in GUN-type biogenic signaling. We conclude that BBX14 is an integrator of photomorphogenetic and biogenic signals, and suggest that BBX14 is a nuclear target of retrograde signals downstream of the GUN1/GLK1 module.",

Our findings demonstrate that HflX does not have a detectable role in plant growth and development, nor does it play a distinct role in acclimation to several different stresses, including heat, manganese, cold, and salt stress. However, we found that HflX is required for plant resistance to chloroplast translational stress mediated by the antibiotic lincomycin.

In this study, we investigated five parameters of iWUE under FL in 200 Minicore rice accessions.

GWAS identifies six candidate genes, and PIF4 is highly expressed in high iWUEFL rice subgroup. Nine SNPs were significantly associated with iWUEFL, and v3 SNP located at -1,075 bp of PIF4 promoter shows highest sensitives to light. Deletion of v3 in a rice cultivar, WYG7 (PIF4v3m) leads to [~]20% reduction in iWUEFL, and overexpressing PIF4 causes 25% increase in iWUEFL under DS. There are 85% reduction in adenosine 3,5-diphosphate (PAP) amounts together with 73% increase in SAL1 gene abundance in PIF4v3m than WYG7. PIF4 transcriptionally repress and activate SAL1 and NHX1, respectively, through binding to G-box motifs of the two genes, which leads to 16% reduction and 5% increase in iWUEFL in co-overexpression rice lines of PIF4-SAL1 and PIF4-NHX1, respectively, relative to PIF4-OE under DS. We proposed that PIF4 promotes iWUEFL and stomatal adjustment via targeting the G-box motif of SAL1 and NHX1 genes during FL, eventually facilitating to drought resistance.",

Loss of ERF1 increases LR density compared with the wild type, whereas ERF1 overexpression causes the opposite phenotype. ERF1 enhances auxin transport by upregulating PIN1 and AUX1, resulting in excessive auxin accumulation in the endodermal, cortical, and epidermal cells surrounding LR primordia. Furthermore, ERF1 represses ARF7 transcription, consequently affecting the expression of cell wall remodeling genes that facilitate LR emergence.

Using a recently developed peat-based gnotobiotic plant growth system we found that Arabidopsis grown in the absence of a natural microbiota lacked age-dependent maturation of plant immune response and were defective in several aspects of pattern-triggered immunity. Axenic plants exhibited hypersusceptibility to infection by the foliar bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato DC3000. Microbiota-mediated immunocompetence was suppressed by rich nutrient conditions, indicating a tripartite interaction between the host, microbiota, and abiotic environment. A synthetic microbiota composed of 48 culturable bacterial strains from the leaf endosphere of healthy Arabidopsis plants was able to substantially restore immunocompetence similar to plants inoculated with a soil-derived community. In contrast, a 52-member dysbiotic synthetic leaf microbiota overstimulated the immune transcriptome. Together, these results provide evidence for a causal role of a eubiotic microbiota in gating proper immunocompetence and age-dependent immunity in plants.",

A paradigm of scheduled supply that is aware of demand but not on-demand is proposed, introducing coordination and social and behavioral understanding, urban cognition and empowerment of agents, into a novel informational framework. Daily routines and other patterns of spatial behaviors outline a fundamental demand layer in a supply-oriented paradigm that captures urban dynamics and spatial-temporal behaviors, mostly in groups. Rather than real-time requests and instant responses that reward unplanned actions, and beyond just reservation of travels in timetables, the intention is to capture mobility flows in scheduled travels along the day considering time of day, places, passengers etc. Regulating goal-directed behaviors and caring for service resources and the overall system welfare is proposed to minimize uncertainty, considering the capacity of mobility interactions to hold value, i.e., Motility as a Service (MaaS). The principal-agent problem in the smart city is a problem of collective action among service providers and users that create expectations based on previous actions and reactions in mutual systems. Planned behavior that accounts for service coordination is expected to stabilize excessive rides and traffic load, and to induce a cognitive gain, thus balancing information load and facilitating cognitive effort.",

Most ERPT studies consider annually aggregated data for developed or large developing countries for estimating ERPT. These estimates vary widely depending on the type of country, data coverage, and frequency. However, the ERPT estimation using firm-level high-frequency export data of a small developing country is rare. In this paper, I estimate the pricing to market and the exchange rate pass-through at a monthly, quarterly, and annual level of data frequency to deal with aggregation bias. Furthermore, I investigate how delivery time-based factors such as frequent shipments and faster transport affect a firm`s pricing-to-market behavior. Using transaction-level export data of Bangladesh from 2005 to 2013 and the Poisson Pseudo Maximum Likelihood (PPML) estimation method, I find very small pricing to the markets to the exchange rates in the exporter's price. As pass-through shows how the exporters respond to macro shocks, for Bangladesh, this low export price response to the exchange rate changes indicates that currency devaluation might not have a significant effect on the exporter. The minimal price response and high pass-through contrast with the literature on incomplete pass-through at the annual level. By considering the characteristics of the firms, products, and destinations, I investigate the heterogeneity of the pass-through. The findings remain consistent with several robustness checks.",

        "abstract": "Index insurance is a promising tool to reduce the risk faced by farmers, but high basis risk, which arises from imperfect correlation between the index and individual farm yields, has limited its adoption to date. Basis risk arises from two fundamental sources: the intrinsic heterogeneity within an insurance zone (zonal risk), and the lack of predictive accuracy of the index (design risk). Whereas previous work has focused almost exclusively on design risk, a theoretical and empirical understanding of the role of zonal risk is still lacking.  Here we investigate the relative roles of zonal and design risk, using the case of maize yields in Kenya. Our first contribution is to derive a formal decomposition of basis risk, providing a simple upper bound on the insurable basis risk that any index can reach within a given zone. Our second contribution is to provide the first large-scale empirical analysis of the extent of zonal versus design risk. To do so, we use satellite estimates of yields at 10m resolution across Kenya, and investigate the effect of using smaller zones versus using different indices. Our results show a strong local heterogeneity in yields, underscoring the challenge of implementing index insurance in smallholder systems, and the potential benefits of low-cost yield measurement approaches that can enable more local definitions of insurance zones.",

In particular, we find that for a variety of estimators the straightforward bootstrap bias correction gives the same higher-order variance as more complicated analytical or jackknife bias corrections. In contrast, bias corrections that do not estimate the bias at the parametric rate, such as the split-sample jackknife, result in larger higher-order variances in the i.i.d. setting we focus on.

        "abstract": "The difference-in-differences (DID) method identifies the average treatment effects on the treated (ATT) under mainly the so-called parallel trends (PT) assumption. The most common and widely used approach to justify the PT assumption is the pre-treatment period examination. If a null hypothesis of the same trend in the outcome means for both treatment and control groups in the pre-treatment periods is rejected, researchers believe less in PT and the DID results. This paper develops a robust generalized DID method that utilizes all the information available not only from the pre-treatment periods but also from multiple data sources. Our approach interprets PT in a different way using a notion of selection bias, which enables us to generalize the standard DID estimand by defining an information set that may contain multiple pre-treatment periods or other baseline covariates. Our main assumption states that the selection bias in the post-treatment period lies within the convex hull of all selection biases in the pre-treatment periods. We provide a sufficient condition for this assumption to hold. Based on the baseline information set we construct, we first provide an identified set for the ATT that always contains the true ATT under our identifying assumption, and also the standard DID estimand. Secondly, we propose a class of criteria on the selection biases from the perspective of policymakers that can achieve a point identification of the ATT. Finally, we illustrate our methodology through some numerical and empirical examples.",
