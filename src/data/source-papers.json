In this paper, we provide a practical survey focused on two key aspects of utilizing LLMs for financial tasks: existing solutions and guidance for adoption.  First, we review current approaches employing LLMs in finance, including leveraging pretrained models via zero-shot or few-shot learning, fine-tuning on domain-specific data, and training custom LLMs from scratch. We summarize key models and evaluate their performance improvements on financial natural language processing tasks.  Second, we propose a decision framework to guide financial professionals in selecting the appropriate LLM solution based on their use case constraints around data, compute, and performance needs. The framework provides a pathway from lightweight experimentation to heavy investment in customized LLMs.  Lastly, we discuss limitations and challenges around leveraging LLMs in financial applications. Overall, this survey aims to synthesize the state-of-the-art and provide a roadmap for responsibly applying LLMs to advance financial AI.","creator":"Yinheng Li, Shaofei Wang, Han Ding, Hang Chen"},{"id":"2311.10725","slug":"should-they-mobile-biometrics-and-technopolicy-meet-queer-community-considerations-arxiv-2311-10725v1-cs-cy","title":"Should they?

The study involves the integration of collision sensors, segmentation, and depth camera for better object detection and distance estimation. The model is tested on 4 different trajectories in presence of different types of 4-wheeled vehicles and pedestrians. The segmentation and depth cameras were utilized to ensure accurate localization of objects and distance measurement. Our proposed method successfully navigated the self-driving vehicle to its final destination with a high success rate without colliding with other vehicles, pedestrians, or going on the sidewalk. To ensure the optimal performance of our reinforcement learning (RL) models in navigating complex traffic scenarios, we implemented a pre-processing step to reduce the state space.

We study how frequently and in which literals contentious terms about people and cultures occur in LOD and whether there are attempts to mark the usage of such terms. For our analysis, we reuse English and Dutch terms from a knowledge graph that provides opinions of experts from the cultural heritage domain about terms' contentiousness.

We found that outdated, derogatory, stereotyping terms frequently appear in descriptive and labelling literals, such as preferred labels that are usually displayed in interfaces and used for indexing. In some cases, LOD contributors mark contentious terms with words and phrases in literals (implicit markers) or properties linked to resources (explicit markers).

Most current methods employ a two-stage process for efficiency: they first select historical behaviors related to the candidate item and then deduce the user's interest from this narrowed-down behavior sub-sequence. This two-stage paradigm, though effective, leads to information loss. Solely using users' lifelong click behaviors doesn't provide a complete picture of their interests, leading to suboptimal performance. In our research, we introduce the Deep Group Interest Network (DGIN), an end-to-end method to model the user's entire behavior history. This includes all post-registration actions, such as clicks, cart additions, purchases, and more, providing a nuanced user understanding. We start by grouping the full range of behaviors using a relevant key (like item_id) to enhance efficiency. This process reduces the behavior length significantly, from O(10^4) to O(10^2). To mitigate the potential loss of information due to grouping, we incorporate two categories of group attributes. Within each group, we calculate statistical information on various heterogeneous behaviors (like behavior counts) and employ self-attention mechanisms to highlight unique behavior characteristics (like behavior type). Based on this reorganized behavior data, the user's interests are derived using the Transformer technique. Additionally, we identify a subset of behaviors that share the same item_id with the candidate item from the lifelong behavior sequence. The insights from this subset reveal the user's decision-making process related to the candidate item, improving prediction accuracy. Our comprehensive evaluation, both on industrial and public datasets, validates DGIN's efficacy and efficiency.","creator":"Qi Liu, Xuyang Hou, Haoran Jin, jin Chen, Zhe Wang, Defu Lian, Tan Qu, Jia Cheng, Jun Lei"},{"id":"2311.10766","slug":"value-fulcra-mapping-large-language-models-to-the-multidimensional-spectrum-of-basic-human-values-arxiv-2311-10766v1-cs-cl","title":"Value FULCRA: Mapping Large Language Models to the Multidimensional Spectrum of Basic Human Values.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10766","abstract":"The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has attracted much attention to value alignment for their responsible development.

In this study, we employ attention mechanisms (AM) to develop data-driven models for predicting LIB lifespan using easily measurable inputs such as voltage, current, temperature, and capacity data. The developed model integrates recurrent neural network (RNN) and convolutional neural network (CNN) components, featuring two types of attention mechanisms: temporal attention (TA) and cyclic attention (CA).

Additionally, CA scores reveal variations in the importance of cycles across batches. By leveraging CA scores, we explore the potential to reduce the number of cycles in the input data.

Furthermore, without accounting for emotions, the systems might overlook undiscovered or lesser-known songs that have a profound emotional impact on users. To combat these limitations, this research introduces an AI model that incorporates emotional context into the song recommendation process. By accurately detecting users real-time emotions, the model can generate personalized song recommendations that align with the users emotional state. This approach aims to enhance the user experience by offering music that resonates with their current mood, elicits the desired emotions, and creates a more immersive and meaningful listening experience.

Our results show that the TaCo method impresses the GPT-4 with 82% for a low-resource language in the Vicuna Benchmark dataset, and boosts performance by double in contrast to the performance of instruction tuning only.

Specifically, the target stock pool of different investors varies dramatically due to their discrepancy on market states and individual investors may temporally adjust stocks they desire to trade (e.g., adding one popular stocks), which lead to customizable stock pools (CSPs). Existing RL methods require to retrain RL agents even with a tiny change of the stock pool, which leads to high computational cost and unstable performance.

Due to the sample-inefficiency of the majority of these works, compositional learning methods have been proposed decomposing the LTL specification into smaller sub-tasks. Then, separate controllers are learned and composed to satisfy the original task. A key challenge within these approaches is that they often lack safety guarantees or the provided guarantees are impractical. This paper aims to address this challenge. Particularly, we consider autonomous systems with unknown and stochastic dynamics and LTL-encoded tasks. We assume that the system is equipped with a finite set of base skills modeled by trained NN feedback controllers. Our goal is to check if there exists a temporal composition of the trained NN controllers - and if so, to compute it - that will yield a composite system behavior that satisfies the assigned LTL task with probability one.

The resulting neuro-symbolic controller allows the agent to generate safe behaviors for unseen complex temporal logic tasks in a zero-shot fashion by leveraging its base skills. We show correctness of the proposed method and we provide conditions under which it is complete.

These networks were repeatable across repeated performance of related tasks, and correspondence of identified functional networks and activation in tasks not used to define the functional networks was shown to accurately identify the presented task. Conclusion: The techniques of functional neuroimaging can be applied to deep neural networks as a means to probe their workings. Identified functional networks hold the potential for use in model alignment, modulation of model output, and identifying weights to target in fine-tuning.","creator":"Andrew S. Nencka, L.

However, the high-dimensional nature of airfoil representation causes the challenging problem known as the \"curse of dimensionality\". To overcome this problem, numerous airfoil parameterization methods have been developed, which can be broadly classified as polynomial-based and data-driven approaches. Each of these methods has desirable characteristics such as flexibility, parsimony, feasibility, and intuitiveness, but a single approach that encompasses all of these attributes has yet to be found. For example, polynomial-based methods struggle to balance parsimony and flexibility, while data-driven methods lack in feasibility and intuitiveness. In recent years, generative models, such as generative adversarial networks and variational autoencoders, have shown promising potential in airfoil parameterization. However, these models still face challenges related to intuitiveness due to their black-box nature. To address this issue, we developed a novel airfoil parameterization method using physics-aware variational autoencoder. The proposed method not only explicitly separates the generation of thickness and camber distributions to produce smooth and non-intersecting airfoils, thereby improving feasibility, but it also directly aligns its latent dimensions with geometric features of the airfoil, significantly enhancing intuitiveness. Finally, extensive comparative studies were performed to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.","creator":"Yu-Eop Kang, Dawoon Lee, Kwanjung Yee"},{"id":"2311.10922","slug":"explainable-product-classification-for-customs-arxiv-2311-10922v1-cs-ai","title":"Explainable Product Classification for Customs.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10922","abstract":"The task of assigning internationally accepted commodity codes (aka HS codes) to traded goods is a critical function of customs offices.

Common explainability methods highlight image regions that drive an AI model's decision. Humans, however, heavily rely on language to convey explanations of not only \"where\" but \"what\". Additionally, most explainability approaches focus on explaining individual AI predictions, rather than describing the features used by an AI model in general. The latter would be especially useful for model and dataset auditing, and potentially even knowledge generation as AI is increasingly being used in novel tasks. Here, we present an explainability strategy that uses a vision-language model to identify language-based descriptors of a visual classification task. By leveraging a pre-trained joint embedding space between images and text, our approach estimates a new classification task as a linear combination of words, resulting in a weight for each word that indicates its alignment with the vision-based classifier. We assess our approach using two medical imaging classification tasks, where we find that the resulting descriptors largely align with clinical knowledge despite a lack of domain-specific language training. However, our approach also identifies the potential for 'shortcut connections' in the public datasets used. Towards a functional measure of explainability, we perform a pilot reader study where we find that the AI-identified words can enable non-expert humans to perform a specialized medical task at a non-trivial level.

Based on this, we propose a new model interpretation approach for recommender systems, by using LLMs as surrogate models and learn to mimic and comprehend target recommender models. Specifically, we introduce three alignment methods: behavior alignment, intention alignment, and hybrid alignment. Behavior alignment operates in the language space, representing user preferences and item information as text to learn the recommendation model's behavior; intention alignment works in the latent space of the recommendation model, using user and item representations to understand the model's behavior; hybrid alignment combines both language and latent spaces for alignment training. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods, we conduct evaluation from two perspectives: alignment effect, and explanation generation ability on three public datasets.

We use these folk concepts as a framework of social attribution by the human explainee - the information constructs that humans are likely to comprehend from explanations - by introducing a blueprint for an explanatory narrative (Figure 1) that explains AI behavior with these constructs. We then demonstrate that many XAI methods today can be mapped to folk concepts of behavior in a qualitative evaluation. This allows us to uncover their failure modes that prevent current methods from explaining successfully - i.e., the information constructs that are missing for any given XAI method, and whose inclusion can decrease the likelihood of misunderstanding AI behavior.","creator":"Alon Jacovi, Jasmijn Bastings, Sebastian Gehrmann, Yoav Goldberg, Katja Filippova"},{"id":"2207.02249","slug":"learning-task-embeddings-for-teamwork-adaptation-in-multi-agent-reinforcement-learning-arxiv-2207-02249v2-cs-ma-updated","title":"Learning Task Embeddings for Teamwork Adaptation in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.02249","abstract":"Successful deployment of multi-agent reinforcement learning often requires agents to adapt their behaviour.

These task embeddings are trained using an encoder-decoder architecture optimised for reconstruction of the transition and reward functions which uniquely identify tasks. We show that a team of agents is able to adapt to novel tasks when provided with task embeddings. We propose three MATE training paradigms: independent MATE, centralised MATE, and mixed MATE which vary in the information used for the task encoding.

Currently, many efforts have been made on curiosity which can provide a representative intrinsic reward for effective exploration. However, the challenge is still far from being solved.

Inspired by human curiosity and information theory, DyMeCu consists of a dynamic memory and dual online learners. The curiosity arouses if memorized information can not deal with the current state, and the information gap between dual learners can be formulated as the intrinsic reward for agents, and then such state information can be consolidated into the dynamic memory. Compared with previous curiosity methods, DyMeCu can better mimic human curiosity with dynamic memory, and the memory module can be dynamically grown based on a bootstrap paradigm with dual learners. On multiple benchmarks including DeepMind Control Suite and Atari Suite, large-scale empirical experiments are conducted and the results demonstrate that DyMeCu outperforms competitive curiosity-based methods with or without extrinsic rewards.

Most existing imitation learning methods that do not require interacting with environments either model the expert distribution as the conditional probability p(a|s) (e.g., behavioral cloning, BC) or the joint probability p(s, a). Despite its simplicity, modeling the conditional probability with BC usually struggles with generalization. While modeling the joint probability can lead to improved generalization performance, the inference procedure is often time-consuming and the model can suffer from manifold overfitting. This work proposes an imitation learning framework that benefits from modeling both the conditional and joint probability of the expert distribution. Our proposed diffusion model-augmented behavioral cloning (DBC) employs a diffusion model trained to model expert behaviors and learns a policy to optimize both the BC loss (conditional) and our proposed diffusion model loss (joint).

In this paper, we propose an efficient yet effective train-time pruning scheme, Parameter-free Differentiable Pruning (PDP), which offers state-of-the-art qualities in model size, accuracy, and training cost. PDP uses a dynamic function of weights during training to generate soft pruning masks for the weights in a parameter-free manner for a given pruning target. While differentiable, the simplicity and efficiency of PDP make it universal enough to deliver state-of-the-art random/structured/channel pruning results on various vision and natural language tasks.

These views are encoded using graph and hypergraph neural networks to capture the representations of nodes, edges, and their associated contexts. By swapping the context embeddings between nodes and edges and measuring the agreement in the embedding space, we enable the mutual detection of node and edge anomalies. Furthermore, BOURNE can eliminate the need for negative sampling, thereby enhancing its efficiency in handling large graphs. Extensive experiments conducted on six benchmark datasets demonstrate the superior effectiveness and efficiency of BOURNE in detecting both node and edge anomalies.","creator":"Jie Liu, Mengting He, Xuequn Shang, Jieming Shi, Bin Cui, Hongzhi Yin"},{"id":"2307.16387","slug":"relation-oriented-toward-causal-knowledge-aligned-agi-arxiv-2307-16387v10-cs-ai-updated","title":"Relation-Oriented: Toward Causal Knowledge-Aligned AGI.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.16387","abstract":"The current relationship modeling paradigm, grounded in the observational i.i.d assumption, fundamentally misaligns with our causal knowledge understanding due to two key oversights: 1) the unobservable relations, which lead to undetectable hierarchical levels of knowledge, driving the need for model generalizability; 2) the cognitive relative timings, which crucially support our structural knowledge comprehension, resulting in inherent biases within the present Observation-Oriented paradigm. Adopting a novel Relation-Oriented perspective, this paper proposes a new framework to unify the various confusions surrounding causality learning, ranging from traditional causal inference to modern language models.

To ensure a lower latency, a shallow model (e.g. FastText) is widely used for efficient online inference. However, the representation ability of the FastText model is insufficient, resulting in poor classification performance, especially on some low-frequency queries and tailed categories. Using a deeper and more complex model (e.g. BERT) is an effective solution, but it will cause a higher online inference latency and more expensive computing costs. Thus, how to juggle both inference efficiency and classification performance is obviously of great practical importance. To overcome this challenge, in this paper, we propose knowledge condensation (KC), a simple yet effective knowledge distillation framework to boost the classification performance of the online FastText model under strict low latency constraints. Specifically, we propose to train an offline BERT model to retrieve more potentially relevant data. Benefiting from its powerful semantic representation, more relevant labels not exposed in the historical data will be added into the training set for better FastText model training. Moreover, a novel distribution-diverse multi-expert learning strategy is proposed to further improve the mining ability of relevant data. By training multiple BERT models from different data distributions, it can respectively perform better at high, middle, and low-frequency search queries. The model ensemble from multi-distribution makes its retrieval ability more powerful. We have deployed two versions of this framework in JD search, and both offline experiments and online A/B testing from multiple datasets have validated the effectiveness of the proposed approach.","creator":"Kun-Peng Ning, Ming Pang, Zheng Fang, Xue Jiang, Xi-Wei Zhao, Chang-Ping Peng, Zhan-Gang Lin, Jing-He Hu, Jing-Ping Shao"},{"id":"2308.10974","slug":"guinea-pig-trials-utilizing-gpt-a-novel-smart-agent-based-modeling-approach-for-studying-firm-competition-and-collusion-arxiv-2308-10974v3-cs-ai-updated","title":"\"Guinea Pig Trials\" Utilizing GPT: A Novel Smart Agent-Based Modeling Approach for Studying Firm Competition and Collusion.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.10974","abstract":"Firm competition and collusion involve complex dynamics, particularly when considering communication among firms. Such issues can be modeled as problems of complex systems, traditionally approached through experiments involving human subjects or agent-based modeling methods. We propose an innovative framework called Smart Agent-Based Modeling (SABM), wherein smart agents, supported by GPT-4 technologies, represent firms, and interact with one another. We conducted a controlled experiment to study firm price competition and collusion behaviors under various conditions. SABM is more cost-effective and flexible compared to conducting experiments with human subjects. Smart agents possess an extensive knowledge base for decision-making and exhibit human-like strategic abilities, surpassing traditional ABM agents. Furthermore, smart agents can simulate human conversation and be personalized, making them ideal for studying complex situations involving communication. Our results demonstrate that, in the absence of communication, smart agents consistently reach tacit collusion, leading to prices converging at levels higher than the Bertrand equilibrium price but lower than monopoly or cartel prices. When communication is allowed, smart agents achieve a higher-level collusion with prices close to cartel prices. Collusion forms more quickly with communication, while price convergence is smoother without it. These results indicate that communication enhances trust between firms, encouraging frequent small price deviations to explore opportunities for a higher-level win-win situation and reducing the likelihood of triggering a price war. We also assigned different personas to firms to analyze behavioral differences and tested variant models under diverse market structures. The findings showcase the effectiveness and robustness of SABM and provide intriguing insights into competition and collusion.","creator":"Xu Han, Zengqing Wu, Chuan Xiao"},{"id":"2308.12634","slug":"towards-hierarchical-regional-transformer-based-multiple-instance-learning-arxiv-2308-12634v2-cs-cv-updated","title":"Towards Hierarchical Regional Transformer-based Multiple Instance Learning.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12634","abstract":"The classification of gigapixel histopathology images with deep multiple instance learning models has become a critical task in digital pathology and precision medicine.

In this paper, we propose an environment-aware affordance framework that incorporates both object-level actionable priors and environment constraints.

In this paper, we introduce SA2-Net, an attention-guided method that leverages multi-scale feature learning to effectively handle diverse structures within microscopic images. Specifically, we propose scale-aware attention (SA2) module designed to capture inherent variations in scales and shapes of microscopic regions, such as cells, for accurate segmentation.

This leads to very large training times due to the volume of experience required to train an agent using this replay strategy.

To our best knowledge, the problem of DP for transfer learning remains open, as previous studies have primarily addressed DP and transfer learning as separate problems.

This study explores using AIS data to prevent vessel-to-whale collisions by forecasting long-term vessel trajectories from engineered AIS data sequences. For such a task, we have developed an encoder-decoder model architecture using Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory Networks (Bi-LSTM) to predict the next 12 hours of vessel trajectories using 1 to 3 hours of AIS data as input. We feed the model with probabilistic features engineered from historical AIS data that refer to each trajectory's potential route and destination.

In this paper, we introduce a new perspective on the EBTTA, which interprets these methods from a view of clustering.

Based on the interpretation, we can gain a deeper understanding of EBTTA, where we show that the entropy loss would further increase the largest probability. Accordingly, we offer an alternative explanation for why existing EBTTA methods are sensitive to initial assignments, outliers, and batch size.

Despite their great successes, recent studies have shown that these advanced recommender systems are highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks, in which attackers can inject well-designed fake user profiles to disrupt recommendation performances. While most existing studies mainly focus on targeted attacks to promote target items on vanilla recommender systems, untargeted attacks to degrade the overall prediction performance are less explored on social recommendations under a black-box scenario.

Most black-box attacks still require certain information from the speaker recognition model to be effective (e.g., keeping probing and requiring the knowledge of similarity scores). This work aims to push the practicality of the black-box attacks by minimizing the attacker's knowledge about a target speaker recognition model. Although it is not feasible for an attacker to succeed with completely zero knowledge, we assume that the attacker only knows a short (or a few seconds) speech sample of a target speaker.

For example, research in reinforcement learning (RL) has been heavily influenced by available environments and benchmarks. However, RL environments are traditionally run on the CPU, limiting their scalability with typical academic compute. Recent advancements in JAX have enabled the wider use of hardware acceleration to overcome these computational hurdles, enabling massively parallel RL training pipelines and environments. This is particularly useful for multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) research. First of all, multiple agents must be considered at each environment step, adding computational burden, and secondly, the sample complexity is increased due to non-stationarity, decentralised partial observability, or other MARL challenges. In this paper, we present JaxMARL, the first open-source code base that combines ease-of-use with GPU enabled efficiency, and supports a large number of commonly used MARL environments as well as popular baseline algorithms. When considering wall clock time, our experiments show that per-run our JAX-based training pipeline is up to 12500x faster than existing approaches. This enables efficient and thorough evaluations, with the potential to alleviate the evaluation crisis of the field. We also introduce and benchmark SMAX, a vectorised, simplified version of the popular StarCraft Multi-Agent Challenge, which removes the need to run the StarCraft II game engine.

There were dramatic differences in pathogen gene expression at 10 DPI in the compatible compared to both incompatible interactions. The largest differences in pathogen gene expression occurred at 3 DPI in both compatible and incompatible interactions compared to the non-host interaction. Thirty-one putative effectors had early expression in the compatible interaction.

Using multi-color fluorescent in situ hybridization, distinct rDNA loci and Arabidopsis-type telomeres were revealed. The 5S rRNA genes were conserved in kenaf and localized in interstitial regions of two chromosomes across all accessions. The 35S rRNA genes were variable across the kenaf accessions and localized at sub-terminal ends and rarely interstitially in eight or six chromosome arms. Telomeric signals were observed at terminal ends of all chromosomes, with smaller signals also interstitially. The chromosome configuration of Ghana kenaf accessions was confirmed to be 2n=2x=36, each.

The abundance of 4/6-InsP7 in land plants, the enzyme(s) responsible for its synthesis, and the physiological functions of this species are all currently unknown. In this study, we show that 4/6-InsP7 is the major PP-InsP species present across land plants. Our findings demonstrate that the Arabidopsis inositol polyphosphate multikinase (IPMK) homolog, AtIPK2 generates 4/6-InsP7 in vitro. Furthermore, the cellular level of 4/6-InsP7 is controlled by the two Arabidopsis IPMK isoforms, AtIPK2 and AtIPK2{beta}. Notably, the activity of these IPMK proteins is critical for heat stress acclimation in Arabidopsis. During heat stress, the expression of genes encoding various heat shock proteins controlled by the heat shock factors (HSFs) is affected in the AtIPK2-deficient plants. Furthermore, we show that the transcription activity of HSF is regulated by the AtIPK2 proteins. Our parallel investigations using the liverwort Marchantia polymorpha suggest that the InsP6 kinase activity of IPMK and the role of IPMK in regulating the heat stress response are evolutionarily conserved. Collectively, our study indicates that IPMK has played a critical role in transducing environmental cues for biological processes during land plant evolution.","creator":"Yadav, R., Liu, G., Rana, P., Pullagurla, N.

This study reports the regulation of the putative carbohydrate-binding protein gene Cs9g12620 by the PthA4-CsLOB1 module during Xcc infection. We found that the transcription of Cs9g12620 was induced by infection with Xcc in a PthA4-dependent manner. Even though it specifically bound to a putative TAL effector-binding element in the Cs9g12620 promoter, PthA4 exerted a suppressive effect on the promoter activity. In contrast, CsLOB1 bound to the Cs9g12620 promoter to activate its activity. The silencing of CsLOB1 significantly reduced the level of expression of Cs9g12620, which demonstrated that Cs9g12620 was directly regulated by CsLOB1. Intriguingly, PhtA4 interacted with CsLOB1 and exerted feedback control that suppressed the induction of expression of Cs9g12620 by CsLOB1. Transient overexpression and gene silencing revealed that Cs9g12620 was required for the optimal development of canker symptoms. These results support the hypothesis that the expression of Cs9g12620 is dynamically directed by PthA4 for canker formation through the PthA4-CsLOB1 regulatory module.","creator":"Chen, X., Zou, H., Zhuo, T., Rou, W., Wu, W., Fan, X."},{"id":"2023.11.15.567147v1","slug":"identification-of-a-putative-rhamnogalacturonan-ii-cmp-beta-kdo-transferase-through-a-callus-based-gene-editing-method-which-overcomes-embryo-lethality","title":"Identification of a putative rhamnogalacturonan-II CMP-beta-Kdo transferase through a callus-based gene editing method which overcomes embryo lethality.","link":"http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2023.11.15.567147v1?rss=1","abstract":"The pectin rhamnogalacturonan II (RG-II) is an extraordinarily complex plant carbohydrate, crucial for developmental processes.

RG-IIs low abundance in the plant cell wall belies its vital role in plant development. Minor structural modifications lead to lethality or severe growth impairment, posing significant challenges for GT identification via reverse genetics.

Here, we used two well established platforms for the study of plant PCD; Arabidopsis thaliana suspension cultures cells and the root hair assay, to examine the roles of the polyamines spermine and spermidine in the regulation of PCD. We demonstrate that both polyamines can trigger PCD when applied exogenously at higher doses, whereas at lower concentrations they inhibit PCD induced by both biotic and abiotic stimuli.

We selected four sites spanning the latitudinal gradient and beech distribution in northern (Trentino-TRE), central (Lazio-LAZ), southern (Campania-CAM) and southernmost Italy (Calabria-CAL) with different climate conditions and soil water availability.  First-order autocorrelation (AR1) analysis was performed to detect early warning signals for potential tree dieback risks during extreme drought events. Results revealed a negative correlation between vapour pressure deficit (VPD) and BAI, especially at southern latitudes. GAMM analysis showed a negative trend in BAI across most sites, stronger at the TRE site following the 2003 drought event. During this event, {delta}13C and iWUE increased with rising VPD, indicative of conservative water-use (lower stomatal conductance) and contributing to the decline in BAI. Conversely, CAM exhibited a steady increase in BAI and iWUE, likely influenced by rising atmospheric CO2 and water availability. LAZ site exhibited a decrease in {delta}13C, attributed to greater soil water holding capacity, enabling it to sustain higher transpiration rates. Conversely, southern sites presented higher iWUE, likely as high VPD initially reduces stomatal conductance but not the net assimilation rate, resulting in increased iWUE. Nevertheless, almost all sites exhibited a co-occurrence of increase in AR1 (except for CAM) and standard deviation, suggesting a reduction of resilience to future extreme events.  Overall, multi-proxy, retrospective quantifications of BAI, iWUE and resilience provide a robust and complementary tool for differentiating water-use strategies and predicting tree growth decline and dieback, as well as identifying those that have the potential to survive in warmer and drier future conditions.","creator":"Puchi, P.

Wild-type (WT) and a double mutant deficient for two main actors of the UPR (INOSITOL-REQUIRING ENZYME 1A and INOSITOL-REQUIRING ENZYME 1B) were used as genetic backgrounds in our experimental setup, allowing to distinguish among differentially-expressed genes (DEGs) which ones are dependent on or independent on IRE1s. Also, shoots and roots were harvested separately to determine organ-specific transcriptomic responses to Tm. Library and sequencing were performed using DNBseq technology by the Beijing Genomics Institute. Reads were mapped and quantified against the Arabidopsis genome. Differentially-expressed genes were identified using Rflomics upon filtering and normalization by the Trimmed Mean of M-value (TMM) method. While the genotype effect was weak under mock conditions (with a total of 182 DEGs in shoots and 195 DEGs in roots), the tunicamycin effect on each genotype was characterized by several hundred of DEGs in both shoots and roots. Among these genes, 872 and 563 genes were statistically up- and down-regulated in the shoot tissues of the double mutant when compared to those of WT, respectively. In roots of Tm-challenged seedlings, 425 and 439 genes were significantly up- and down-regulated in mutants with respect to WT.

We found that PHYB recruits PHYTOCHROME-INTERACTING FACTOR5 (PIF5) to PBs and, surprisingly, that PHYB exerts opposing roles in degrading and stabilizing PIF5. Perturbing PB size by overproducing PHYB provoked a biphasic PIF5 response: while a moderate increase in PHYB enhanced PIF5 degradation, further elevating the PHYB level stabilized PIF5 by retaining more of it in enlarged PBs. Our results support a model in which PHYB condensation stabilizes PIF5 in PBs to counteract PIF5 degradation in the surrounding nucleoplasm, thereby enabling an environmentally sensitive counterbalancing mechanism to titrate nucleoplasmic PIF5 and its transcriptional output. This PB-enabled signaling mechanism provides a framework for regulating a plethora of PHYB-interacting signaling molecules in diverse plant environmental responses. We propose that this function of PBs represents a general function of biomolecular condensates to allow distinct variations of a cellular process or signaling pathway to coexist and interact to generate dynamically adjustable integrated outputs within a single subcellular space.","creator":"Kim, R.

These include biochemical rate limitations, internal and external water potentials, temperature, irradiance, and carbon dioxide (CO2). Amphistomatous leaves have stomata on both abaxial and adaxial leaf surfaces. This feature is considered an adaptation to alleviate CO2 diffusion limitations in productive environments where other factors are not limiting as the diffusion path length from stomate to chloroplast is effectively halved. Plants can also reduce CO2 limitations through other aspects of optimal stomatal anatomy: stomatal density, distribution, patterning, and size. A number of studies have demonstrated that stomata are overdispersed on a single leaf surface; however, much less is known about stomatal anatomy in amphistomatous leaves, especially the coordination between leaf surfaces, despite their prevelance in nature and near ubiquity among crop species. Here we use novel spatial statistics based on simulations and photosynthesis modeling to test hypotheses about how amphistomatous plants may optimize CO2 limitations in the model angiosperm Arabidopsis thaliana grown in different light environments. We find that 1) stomata are overdispersed, but not ideally dispersed, on both leaf surfaces across all light treatments; 2) abaxial and adaxial leaf surface patterning are independent; and 3) the theoretical improvements to photosynthesis from abaxial-adaxial stomatal coordination are miniscule (<< 1%) across the range of feasible parameter space. However, we also find that 4) stomatal size is correlated with the mesophyll volume that it supplies with CO2, suggesting that plants may optimize CO2 diffusion limitations through alternative pathways other than ideal, uniform stomatal spacing.

Understanding this entire process is crucial for developing strategies to manipulate bloom time to prevent crop loss due to climate change. Here, we present a detailed examination of flower development from initiation until bloom for early- and late-blooming sour cherries (Prunus cerasus) from a population segregating for a major bloom time QTL on chromosome 4. Using a new staging system, we identified floral buds from early-blooming trees were persistently more advanced than those from late-blooming siblings. A gDNA coverage analysis revealed the late-blooming haplotype of this QTL, k, is located on a subgenome originating from the late-blooming P. fruticosa progenitor. Transcriptome analyses identified a large number of genes within this QTL as differentially expressed between early- and late-blooming trees during the vegetative-to-floral transition. From these, we identified candidate genes for the late bloom phenotype, including multiple transcription factors homologous to REproductive Meristem (REM) B3 domain-containing proteins. Additionally, we determined the basis of k in sour cherry is likely separate from candidate genes found in sweet cherry - suggesting several major regulators of bloom time are located on Prunus chromosome 4.  HIGHLIGHTDormancy is a main effector of bloom time in fruit trees. However, developmental, genetic, and transcriptomic analyses indicate differences in flower development before dormancy significantly influence flowering time in cherry.","creator":"Goeckeritz, C.

As opposed to complete-information oligopoly games, coexisting attractors, disconnected basins of attractions and chaotic dynamics emerge when the Cournot-Nash equilibrium loses stability. This difference in the global dynamics is due to the nonlinearities introduced by the worst-case approach to uncertainty, which mirror in bimodal best-reply functions.

In particular, measures that contribute to the interconnection of energy vectors and domains, e.g. heating, cooling, and electricity supply, in the sense of decentralized multi-energy systems are a promising future development option. Due to the high complexity resulting from a multitude of decision options as well as a temporal coupling across the transformation path, the use of optimization methods is required, which enable a bottom-up identification of suitable transformation solutions in a high spatial resolution.

The results show that the heat supply in the future will mainly be provided by heat pumps with a share of 60%.

Traditional methods for incorporating these factors into choice models do not account for the entire social network and require hand-crafted features. To overcome these limitations, we use graph learning to study choice in networked contexts. We identify three ways in which graph learning techniques can be used for discrete choice: learning chooser representations, regularizing choice model parameters, and directly constructing predictions from a network.

We propose an innovative framework called Smart Agent-Based Modeling (SABM), wherein smart agents, supported by GPT-4 technologies, represent firms, and interact with one another. We conducted a controlled experiment to study firm price competition and collusion behaviors under various conditions. SABM is more cost-effective and flexible compared to conducting experiments with human subjects. Smart agents possess an extensive knowledge base for decision-making and exhibit human-like strategic abilities, surpassing traditional ABM agents. Furthermore, smart agents can simulate human conversation and be personalized, making them ideal for studying complex situations involving communication. Our results demonstrate that, in the absence of communication, smart agents consistently reach tacit collusion, leading to prices converging at levels higher than the Bertrand equilibrium price but lower than monopoly or cartel prices. When communication is allowed, smart agents achieve a higher-level collusion with prices close to cartel prices. Collusion forms more quickly with communication, while price convergence is smoother without it. These results indicate that communication enhances trust between firms, encouraging frequent small price deviations to explore opportunities for a higher-level win-win situation and reducing the likelihood of triggering a price war. We also assigned different personas to firms to analyze behavioral differences and tested variant models under diverse market structures. The findings showcase the effectiveness and robustness of SABM and provide intriguing insights into competition and collusion.","creator":"Xu Han, Zengqing Wu, Chuan Xiao"},{"id":"2309.07476","slug":"causal-inference-in-network-experiments-regression-based-analysis-and-design-based-properties-arxiv-2309-07476v2-econ-em-updated","title":"Causal inference in network experiments: regression-based analysis and design-based properties.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07476","abstract":"Investigating interference or spillover effects among units is a central task in many social science problems. Network experiments are powerful tools for this task, which avoids endogeneity by randomly assigning treatments to units over networks. However, it is non-trivial to analyze network experiments properly without imposing strong modeling assumptions. Previously, many researchers have proposed sophisticated point estimators and standard errors for causal effects under network experiments. We further show that regression-based point estimators and standard errors can have strong theoretical guarantees if the regression functions and robust standard errors are carefully specified to accommodate the interference patterns under network experiments. We first recall a well-known result that the Hajek estimator is numerically identical to the coefficient from the weighted-least-squares fit based on the inverse probability of the exposure mapping. Moreover, we demonstrate that the regression-based approach offers three notable advantages: its ease of implementation, the ability to derive standard errors through the same weighted-least-squares fit, and the capacity to integrate covariates into the analysis, thereby enhancing estimation efficiency. Furthermore, we analyze the asymptotic bias of the regression-based network-robust standard errors. Recognizing that the covariance estimator can be anti-conservative, we propose an adjusted covariance estimator to improve the empirical coverage rates. Although we focus on regression-based point estimators and standard errors, our theory holds under the design-based framework, which assumes that the randomness comes solely from the design of network experiments and allows for arbitrary misspecification of the regression models.","creator":"Mengsi Gao, Peng Ding"},{"id":"2310.14590","slug":"can-the-black-lives-matter-movement-reduce-racial-disparities-evidence-from-medical-crowdfunding-arxiv-2310-14590v2-econ-gn-updated","title":"Can the Black Lives Matter Movement Reduce Racial Disparities?

The reduction is largely attributed to non-Black donors. Those beneficiaries in counties with moderate BLM activities were most impacted. We construct innovative instrumental variable approaches that utilize weekends and rainfall to identify the global and local effects of BLM protests. Results suggest a broad social movement has a greater influence on charitable-giving behavior than a local event. Social media significantly magnifies the impact of protests.","creator":"Kaixin Liu, Jiwei Zhou, Junda Wang"},{"id":"2310.18836","slug":"design-of-cluster-randomized-trials-with-cross-cluster-interference-arxiv-2310-18836v2-stat-me-updated","title":"Design of Cluster-Randomized Trials with Cross-Cluster Interference.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.18836","abstract":"Cluster-randomized trials often involve units that are irregularly distributed in space without well-separated communities. In these settings, cluster construction is a critical aspect of the design due to the potential for cross-cluster interference. The existing literature relies on partial interference models, which take clusters as given and assume no cross-cluster interference. We relax this assumption by allowing interference to decay with geographic distance between units. This induces a bias-variance trade-off: constructing fewer, larger clusters reduces bias due to interference but increases variance. We propose new estimators that exclude units most potentially impacted by cross-cluster interference and show that this substantially reduces asymptotic bias relative to conventional difference-in-means estimators. We provide formal justification for a new design that chooses the number of clusters to balance the asymptotic bias and variance of our estimators and uses unsupervised learning to automate cluster construction.","creator":"Michael P.

In this paper we investigate the difficulty of identifying prominent outcomes in two kinds of binary action coordination problems in social networks: pure coordination games and anti-coordination games. For both environments, we determine the computational complexity of finding a strategy profile that (i) maximises welfare, (ii) maximises welfare subject to being an equilibrium, and (iii) maximises potential. We show that the complexity of these objectives can vary with the type of coordination problem. Objectives (i) and (iii) are tractable problems in pure coordination games, but for anti-coordination games are NP-hard. Objective (ii), finding the best Nash equilibrium, is NP-hard for both. Our results support the idea that environments in which actions are strategic complements (e.g., technology adoption) facilitate successful coordination more readily than those in which actions are strategic substitutes (e.g., public good provision).","creator":"Argyrios Deligkas, Eduard Eiben, Gregory Gutin, Philip R.
