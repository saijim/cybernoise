		"abstract": "In a world where current digital signatures are at risk from quantum computers and Shor's algorithm, a new solution is needed. This work proposes a hybrid digital signature protocol that combines the power of symmetric keys generated by QKD with classical and quantum technologies. This new protocol allows for simple message signing and verifying, and is independent of message length. It is also secure, with integrity, authenticity, and non-repudiation properties. The three-user scenario consists of one sender and two receivers, providing a reliable solution for future communications.",

		"title": "Multilingual Voice Recognition with Gated Language Experts and Curriculum Training",
		"abstract": "The future of voice recognition is here. The team presents gated language experts, a revolutionary approach to improve multilingual transformer transducer models without any language identification input from users. By defining a gating mechanism, they allow transformer encoders to learn language-dependent information and construct the multilingual transformer block with gated transformer experts and shared transformer layers for compact models. Applying linear experts on joint network output to regularize speech acoustic and token label joint information further enhances their approach. They even propose a curriculum training scheme for better serving their corresponding languages. Evaluated on English and Spanish, their methods achieve an average of 12.5% and 7.3% relative word error reduction over baseline bilingual and monolingual models, respectively, obtaining similar results to the upper-bound model trained and inferred with oracle LID. Their approach extends seamlessly to trilingual, quadrilingual, and pentalingual models. The future of voice recognition has never been this bright.",

		"abstract": "This work explores the potential of a multi-task cybernetic neural network using an augmented input vector containing trainable task parameters. By coupling this learning architecture with a fully shared neural network, the authors describe a powerful task adaption mechanism, offering great potential for a low-dimensional task parameter space. Specifically, it is shown that one scalar task parameter is sufficient to approximate a range of tasks, which simplifies workflows related to updating models and training new tasks. Moreover, this neural network architecture demonstrates robustness towards situations with fewer data points. The authors compare the performance of this architecture to similar neural networks using ten different datasets, showing that it performs well across a wide range of applications.",

		"abstract": "In the dystopian world of cyberpunk, Scarf's algorithm provides a powerful pivoting procedure to find a dominating vertex in down-monotone polytopes. This paper explores the application of Scarf's algorithm in finding stable matchings in bipartite graphs. The algorithm is shown to be implementable in a polynomial time, a remarkable result in light of the significant settings it operates on. However, this paper reveals an inherent weakness in the approach by demonstrating an infinite family of instances where it outputs a matching from an exponentially small subset of all stable matchings, regardless of the pivoting rule and runtime. Despite this structural issue, the future looks optimistic as new algorithms and technologies are being developed to overcome its limitations.",

		"abstract": "In the IoT-to-Cloud spectrum, stream processing is crucial for distilling information from continuous data streams. Dedicated Stream Processing Engines (SPEs) run streaming applications that follow the DataFlow model, in which graphs of operators transform data into desired results. With an abundance of SPEs, understanding which SPEs support a given application is not trivial. The authors show that common SPE operators can be expressed as compositions of a minimalistic Aggregate operator, which can run on any framework able to run compositions of such an operator. The Aggregate operator relies on key-based and time-based window partitioning and outputs up to one value per analyzed window. Experimental results show that an SPE relying only on the Aggregate operator can compare favorably with operator-specific implementations, thus enhancing scalability of IoT applications. Their findings define a concise set of requirements for data processing frameworks to support streaming applications.",

Challenges such as image artifacts and complex cortical anatomy have hindered the production of topologically correct corticol segmentations. To address these difficulties, a team of scientists has developed a novel approach using a deep learning framework that incorporates prior knowledge of the geometry of the cortex. This new approach employs a unique loss function based on Laplace's equation to locally penalize unresolved boundaries between tightly folded sulci. The team evaluated the performance of the system in comparison to a baseline network on an ex vivo MRI dataset of human medial temporal lobe specimens, demonstrating significant improvement both quantitatively and qualitatively. This new and innovative approach paves the way for more accurate cortical segmentation and ultimately better neuroprosthetics systems.",
