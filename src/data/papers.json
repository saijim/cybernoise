    "title": "Mitigating Model Bias with Backdoor Attack-based Artificial Bias",
    "intro": "As machine learning models become increasingly prominent in our everyday lives, it is becoming increasingly important to ensure that these models do not exhibit biases that could lead to unfair or unethical outcomes. In recent work, researchers have found that the backdoor attack technique can be used to construct an artificial bias that is similar to the model bias observed in standard training. In this article, we explore the use of backdoor attack-based artificial bias for debiasing machine learning models, and propose a new framework for doing so.",
    "text": "Machine learning algorithms are becoming ubiquitous in our society, as they are used to make decisions in many areas of our lives, such as loan applications, job hiring, and healthcare. However, these algorithms can sometimes exhibit biases, leading to unfair or unethical outcomes. Debiasing machine learning models is an important task, but it is not always a straightforward one. Previous methods for debiasing models have faced challenges such as poor utilization of data or intricate training requirements. However, recent research has shown that the backdoor attack technique can be used to construct an artificial bias that is similar to the model bias observed in standard training. This method involves adding a small amount of perturbation to the data during training, which causes the model to learn a biased representation of the data. \n\nThe researchers propose a new framework for debiasing models based on backdoor attack-based artificial bias. The goal of this framework is to carefully design a reverse artificial bias that can be used to mitigate the model bias derived from standard training. The framework utilizes knowledge distillation to minimize the security risks associated with the backdoor attack, while also effectively reducing the model bias from the original data. \n\nThe researchers tested their framework on both image and structured datasets and found that it provided promising results in mitigating model bias. This research advances our understanding of backdoor attacks and highlights their potential for beneficial applications. By using this framework, it may be possible to create more fair and just machine learning models that can be used to benefit society as a whole.",

    "intro": "Are you tired of slow and inaccurate deep learning models? Well, the future of efficient neural networks is here! Ternary quantization is the revolutionary method that can improve your model's inference time, model size, and accuracy. In this article, we will explore the evolution of ternary quantization and investigate its unique advantages over other quantization methods.",
    "text": "In today's world, deploying deep neural network models come with several challenges. Inference time, model size, and accuracy are of utmost importance and could be the deciding factors when it comes to the adoption of new models. Pruning and quantization have been the mainstream methods used to compress neural network models with faster inference and higher accuracy. Quantization aims to reduce the computational overhead and improve the inference speed by converting individual float values of layer weights to low-precision ones. In this context, ternary quantization stands out as a highly effective method.\n\nTernary quantization allows us to represent each weight in a neural network with only three values: -1, 0, or 1. This method offers numerous advantages over binary quantization due to the addition of the 0 value. This addition can improve the model's accuracy without sacrificing the benefits of quantization. One prominent feature of ternary quantization is that it can represent both positive and negative values unlike binary quantization. This is important since the sign of the weight is crucial for the model's accuracy.\n\nResearchers have studied several methods for ternary quantization, and these methods can be categorized into two groups based on the projection function and optimization methods. In the first group, the projection function maps a real number to -1, 0, or 1. The second group involves optimization methods that constrain layer weights to ternary values during the training process.\n\nRecent studies have shown that ternary quantization can significantly improve model accuracy while reducing the model size and inference time. Research has also shown that ternary quantization outperforms other quantization methods such as binary quantization, low-bit quantization, and vector quantization in terms of model compression and accuracy.\n\nIn conclusion, ternary quantization is the future of efficient neural networks. It is a highly effective method that can improve model speed, accuracy, and reduce the model size. This method offers advantages over other quantization methods and can revolutionize the usage of deep neural network models. As we continue to explore and optimize ternary quantization, we can expect more advancements in the field of efficient neural networks.",

Despite the high quality of TTS models, they have been limited to producing neutral speech, leaving listeners hanging flat whether they're listening to a poem or a news article. But now, thanks to a recent breakthrough, TTS models are finally starting to tap into the emotional spectrum of the human voice.\n\nFor years, researchers have attempted to develop controllable TTS models, but their efforts have been hampered by the difficulty of assigning emotion intensity and distinguishing between different emotions. But the new fine-grained emotional TTS model takes a completely different approach, zeroing in on both inter- and intra-class distances to create speech with convincingly recognizable intensity differences. The results of subjective and objective experiments found that this TTS model not only excels in controllability, but also in emotion expressiveness and naturalness, far surpassing two current models in the field.\n\nWhat's even more impressive is the potential of this technology to change the way we interact with TTS. From audiobooks to customer service bots, this fine-grained emotional control could revolutionize the listening experience, giving listeners the power to fully immerse themselves in a wide range of emotions.\n\nSo what's next for TTS technology?

Recently, researchers have proposed a structure coherence-based multi-modal fact verification scheme using artificial intelligence (AI) to classify fake news. In this article, we explore this cutting-edge approach that combines CLIP, Sentence BERT, and ResNet50 to create a system that can detect structural coherence between claims and documents in a text. The results of this approach were impressive and helped the researchers achieve 2nd place in the FACTIFY2 challenge. In the following sections, we explore the importance of this system and how it is helping to combat fake news.",
    "text": "Fake news has become a major problem on social media platforms, with misinformation and propaganda filling up newsfeeds and timelines. It is no surprise that people are struggling to differentiate between truth and falsehood. Fortunately, researchers have begun to tackle this problem with AI-driven technologies that can detect fake news automatically. Most recently, the FACTIFY2 challenge at AAAI2023 showcased some of the most innovative approaches to multi-modal fact verification. One of these approaches was a structure coherence-based multi-modal fact verification scheme, which achieved an impressive 0.8079 weighted average F1 score, securing 2nd place in the competition.\n\nThe structure coherence of a text is key to detecting fake news. It refers to the coherence between the claim and the document that supports it. A text that contains structural coherence will be more likely to be true than one that does not. Researchers designed a system that utilizes sentence length, vocabulary similarity, semantic similarity, and image similarity to determine structural coherence. The system extracts text features through CLIP and Sentence BERT and uses ResNet50 to extract image features. Text length and lexical similarity are also extracted and concatenated with the features before being passed through the random forest classifier. The results of this system are impressive and demonstrate the potential of AI-driven fact-checking.\n\nThe use of AI to tackle fake news has broad implications, including reducing the impact of disinformation campaigns and increasing public trust in media outlets. The structure coherence-based multi-modal fact verification scheme has the potential to become an invaluable tool in the fight against fake news. Moreover, with further advancements, this AI-driven approach could lead to faster and even more accurate results.\n\nOverall, the FACTIFY2 challenge was a testament to the ingenuity and creativity of researchers using AI to tackle social problems. The structure coherence-based multi-modal fact verification scheme presented in this paper is a step towards a larger and more important goal of combating disinformation in social media. It shows that AI has the potential to make a meaningful contribution to this important issue.",

By utilizing this model, we have been able to revolutionize the field of compiler optimization. In this article, we will dive into the fascinating world of BenchDirect and explore its unprecedented performance.",
    "text": "The increasing complexity of hardware-software has made it challenging to find optimal optimization heuristics in compilers. While predictive models have been successful in identifying near-optimal heuristics with little human effort, their performance is limited due to a lack of diverse benchmarks to train on. This is where BenchDirect comes in. It is a machine learning compiler benchmark generator that directs AI to target specific features of interest in the code. It achieves unparalleled accuracy when compared to other benchmark generators and is even more accurate than human-written code in many cases. \n\nResearchers have utilized generative AI to synthesize benchmarks into existing datasets. However, the synthetic programs are often too simple and lack diversity in their features. BenchDirect solves these issues by using a directed LM that infills programs based on source code context and the compiler features that are targeted. This model has enabled us to achieve up to 36% better accuracy in targeting the features of Rodinia benchmarks. Moreover, it is even 1.8x more likely to produce an exact match with human-written code, further demonstrating its effectiveness in generating high-quality benchmarks.\n\nBenchDirect utilizes a process called active learning to introduce new benchmarks with features that have not been seen before in existing datasets. The model is capable of infilling programs by jointly observing source code context and the compiler features that are targeted. This has resulted in programs that are difficult to distinguish from human-written code. In fact, we have conducted a Turing test which shows that our models' synthetic benchmarks are labelled as 'human-written' as often as human-written code from GitHub.\n\nUsing BenchDirect to generate benchmarks has even resulted in faster execution times. Our model speeds up execution time by up to 72%, which in turn saves valuable time for engineers working on the optimization process. \n\nIn conclusion, BenchDirect is a crucial technological leap that has revolutionized the world of compiler optimization. With its directed AI model and unprecedented accuracy, BenchDirect is at the forefront of compiler benchmark generation.

    "intro": "Imagine a future where cancer diagnosis can be made with greater accuracy and speed using computer vision in biomedical microscopy. With the latest breakthroughs in self-supervised visual representation learning, this future may not be so far away. Recently, a team of researchers has developed HiDisc, a machine learning method that leverages patient-slide-patch hierarchy to learn features of the underlying cancer diagnosis using natural patch diversity without strong data augmentations. In this article, we explore how this technology is revolutionizing biomedical microscopy.",
    "text": "In the past, self-supervised representation learning (SSL) methods for biomedical microscopy have not taken into account the inherent patient-slide-patch hierarchy, resulting in limited accuracy and performance. However, HiDisc is capable of defining a hierarchical discriminative learning task that implicitly learns the features of the underlying cancer diagnosis. By utilizing a self-supervised contrastive learning framework, HiDisc can define positive patch pairs based on a common ancestry in the data hierarchy. The result is a visual SSL that uses a unified patch, slide, and patient discriminative learning objective to learn high-quality visual representations.",
