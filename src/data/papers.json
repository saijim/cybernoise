However, some AI algorithms have been discovered to exhibit biases and provide unequal results. In this article, we will explore how the relatively new concept of backdoor attacks can be used to mitigate model bias in AI systems.","text":"Model bias, also known as algorithmic bias, is a significant challenge in AI, where an AI system is systematically unfair towards certain groups of people typically based on their age, gender, or race. Debiasing of a model is an essential step for developing fair AI systems. However, current debiasing methods face challenges such as poor utilization of data or intricate training requirements. In this work, researchers discovered that backdoor attacks, a relatively new concept in cybersecurity, can be used to mitigate model bias in AI systems. \n\nA backdoor attack is an attack where a piece of code is secretly inserted into a model to allow a third party to take control of the model. With the backdoor attack, an attacker can construct an artificial bias that resembles a model bias derived in standard training. However, researchers have found that these backdoor triggers can be used to create reverse artificial bias as well. They used this insight to develop a backdoor debiasing framework based on knowledge distillation.\n\nThe proposed backdoor debiasing framework takes an initial AI system with model bias and trains a second AI system to predict both the correct answer and the presence of backdoor triggers. The second model then predicts the outcome for new data, and its predictions are compared to the first modelâ€™s predictions. Based on this comparison, the backdoor debiasing framework can remove the artificial bias introduced by the backdoor triggers and, consequently, mitigate the model bias from the original data.\n\nResearchers validated their framework on both image and structured datasets, showing that it effectively reduced the model bias in AI systems. The backdoor debiasing framework also minimizes security risks from the backdoor attack as it is designed to recognize and remove backdoor triggers. While further research is needed to fine-tune this method, this work is an essential step towards developing fair, secure, and bias-free AI systems.","keywords":["AI systems","backdoor attacks","model bias","debiasing methods","knowledge distillation"],"prompt":"An image of an AI system being constrained by biased data and then freed by backdoor debiasing framework.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.01504","id":"cec2dfe7c1a35bcc280f0ba164ff84b3","slug":"using-backdoor-attacks-to-mitigate-model-bias-in-ai-systems"},{"title":"Ternary Quantization: The Future of Faster and More Accurate AI Models for Cyberpunk","summary":"Learn about the cutting-edge ternary quantization method for compressing neural network models to enhance their inference time, model size, and accuracy.","intro":"Are you tired of slow and bulky AI models?

However, it can be difficult for people to trust AI systems when they cannot understand how they arrived at their conclusions. This has led to the development of various methods to explain these systems, but each method has its own quirks and idiosyncrasies, making it difficult to compare or combine them. Until now...","text":"Scientists have developed a mathematical framework that unites 14 different methods for explaining artificial intelligence systems. These methods, known as attribution methods, try to tease apart the contribution of each input variable to the final output of the AI system. Attribution methods are like a set of detective tools that can help us understand how the AI system arrived at its conclusion. However, because they are based on different heuristics, there is often no clear agreement among them about which variables are most important in any given case.\n\nTo overcome this problem, the researchers have brought together all 14 methods into one mathematical framework, which they call the system of Taylor interactions. This framework shows that all 14 methods are based on interactions between input variables. Some methods focus on individual variables, while others look at the relationships between pairs of variables, or even higher-order interactions. \n\nThe researchers found that all methods are essentially trying to estimate two types of effects: independent effects of each individual input variable and interaction effects between input variables. The different methods vary in how they allocate weights to these different effects. \n\nTo evaluate the accuracy and trustworthiness of the attribution methods, the researchers propose three principles for a fair allocation of effects. These principles help ensure that the attribution methods, which can have significant societal implications, are trustworthy, transparent, and unbiased.\n\nThis new understanding of the attribution methods will help us better explain how AI systems make decisions, and provide more accurate and fair results.

This is where AI models help in finding near-optimal heuristics with minimal human effort. However, the lack of diverse benchmarks is a major limitation for effective machine learning prediction models. This is where BenchPress, an AI compiler benchmark generator comes in, to produce benchmarks that synthetic programs lack in terms of diversity and complexity. BenchPress uses active learning to introduce new benchmarks with diverse features. In this benchmark generation process of BenchPress, active learning iteratively explores the feature space while focusing on a test program for a CPU vs GPU heuristic in Grewe et al.

BenchDirect uses a directed language model to infill programs into source code context and target compiler features simultaneously to generate benchmarks of increased complexity and diversity. With Beam search and feature-agnostic language models, BenchDirect surpasses the accuracy of previous benchmark generators, achieving up to 36% better accuracy in targeting the features of Rodinia benchmarks.

However, for Canadian hard red spring wheat (HRSW), there was no evidence of osmotic adjustment serving as a mechanism for drought tolerance.

Stomatal behavior refers to how the stomata, tiny pores on the leaves' surface, respond to water availability by opening and closing. HRSW crops were found to have efficient transition from onset to full stomatal closure, aiding in keeping leaf hydration strong. Additionally, early leaf roll, which refers to leaves curling and reducing flag leaf width before undergoing dehydration, also supported HRSW's drought resilience. Results of the study prove that these cultivars lack OA but use stomatal behavior and early leaf roll to thrive under drought conditions.","keywords":["Canadian hard red spring wheat","drought tolerance","osmotic adjustment","stomatal behavior","leaf roll"],"prompt":"An image of a farm with green HRSW crops surrounded by dry and barren land","link":"http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2023.03.05.531113v1?rss=1","id":"523ed8f7b7ebb945adf1fc55ec32b8de","slug":"how-canadian-hard-red-spring-wheat-thrives-in-drought-with-efficient-stomatal-behavior-and-early-leaf-roll"},{"title":"Unlocking the Secrets of Barley's Drought Resilience: Discovering Key Genes Involved in Adaptation and Recovery","summary":"A team of researchers has identified key gene networks and transcriptional patterns involved in the resilience of barley to drought.

They found that each variety had a different critical soil water content (SWC), with Hankkija 673 responding at the highest and Golden Promise at the lowest. This suggests that the different varieties have adapted to distinct rainfall patterns, which could be useful in developing drought-tolerant crops for specific regions. \n\nWhen subjected to drought, the pathways connected to drought and salinity response were strongly upregulated, while pathways connected to growth and development were strongly downregulated. This indicates that the plant prioritizes its survival and resource allocation during drought. During recovery, the growth and development pathways were upregulated, with several strongly differentially expressed genes identified that were not earlier associated with drought response in barley.\n\nOne interesting finding was the strong transcriptional upregulation of retrotransposon BARE1 during drought, which was then downregulated during recovery. The team also identified 117 networked genes involved in ubiquitin-mediated autophagy that were downregulated during recovery, suggesting a role for autophagy in drought response. Further investigation is necessary to determine the importance of autophagy for resilience to drought. \n\nOverall, this study sheds light on the complex molecular mechanisms underlying barley's drought resilience and provides valuable insights for developing drought-tolerant crops in the future.","keywords":["drought","barley","resilience","gene networks","RNA-seq"],"prompt":"An image of a barley field with raindrops falling onto the plants.

To develop rice varieties that can withstand these challenges, researchers have been exploring the role of the PIF4 gene in promoting intrinsic water use efficiency (iWUE) in rice. iWUE is the ratio of carbon fixed during photosynthesis to the amount of water lost through transpiration. Higher iWUE means the plant can grow more while using less water. In this study, researchers investigated the role of PIF4 in promoting iWUE under fluctuating light conditions in 200 Minicore rice accessions.\n\nThe researchers identified a novel parameter called WUEFL, which is the average iWUE during fluctuating light. They found that PIF4 is highly expressed in high iWUEFL rice varieties, and GWAS analysis identified six candidate genes, among which PIF4 was the most promising. Further, they discovered nine SNPs that were significantly associated with iWUEFL, with the v3 SNP located at -1,075 bp of PIF4 promoter showing the highest sensitivity to light.\n\nTo validate the role of PIF4, the researchers performed experiments on two rice varieties: WYG7 and WYG7-PIF4v3m. They found that WYG7-PIF4v3m, a rice cultivar with v3 deletion, had a ~20% reduction in iWUEFL, while overexpressing PIF4 in WYG7 led to a 25% increase in iWUEFL under drought stress. Interestingly, compared to WYG7, PIF4v3m showed an 85% reduction in adenosine 3',5'-diphosphate (PAP) amounts together with a 73% increase in SAL1 gene abundance. PIF4 transcriptionally represses and activates SAL1 and NHX1, respectively, through binding to G-box motifs of the two genes, which leads to a 16% reduction and a 5% increase in iWUEFL in co-overexpression rice lines of PIF4-SAL1 and PIF4-NHX1, respectively, relative to PIF4-OE under drought stress.\n\nThis study provides a new perspective on the mechanism of iWUE regulation in rice under fluctuating light conditions. The identification of SNP markers for iWUEFL and the role of PIF4 in regulating the expression of key genes involved in water use efficiency and drought resistance open up new avenues for breeding high-yielding and drought-resistant rice varieties.

Auxin, a hormone that stimulates root growth, is a key factor in the process. However, until now, scientists had limited knowledge of how plants control the distribution and accumulation of auxin. This is where the ERF1 gene comes in. \n\nAs the research shows, ERF1 acts as a negative regulator of lateral root emergence by enhancing auxin transport within the plant. Specifically, it promotes the expression of genes that transport auxin across the plant, resulting in excessive auxin accumulation in the cells surrounding lateral root primordia. This, in turn, alters the distribution of auxin, inhibiting the emergence of lateral roots. \n\nThe study also found that ERF1 represses the expression of ARF7, a transcription factor that controls the expression of genes responsible for cell wall remodeling, which are crucial for successful lateral root emergence. The findings suggest that ERF1 fine-tunes the expression of ARF7 to ensure that lateral root formation occurs only when conditions are favorable. \n\nWhat does this mean for agriculture?

Rich nutrient conditions can substantially affect microbiota-mediated immunocompetence. A balance between the host, microbiota, and abiotic environment plays a critical role in triggering proper immunocompetence.

The proposed approach involves a new class of control problems, which the researchers solve under three different specifications of utility functions for both the agent and the principal.\n\nOne of the key challenges in solving this problem is the control of a forward Volterra equation via Volterra-type controls, and infinite-dimensional stochastic target constraints. Despite this challenge, the researchers draw qualitative implications from the form of the optimal contract, providing valuable insights for future research.\n\nThis approach has the potential to revolutionize the way we tackle time-inconsistency and moral hazard problems in contracts, leading to more efficient and equitable outcomes for all parties involved. Imagine a world where contracts are tailored to handle various types of agents' behavior and prevent negative externalities. With this novel approach, that future may be closer than we think.","keywords":["contract theory","moral hazard problem","time-inconsistent behavior","dynamic programming approach","control problems"],"prompt":"An AI-generated image of a futuristic contract, with a sleek and polished design that looks both technologically advanced and easy to understand.

Firstly, not all agents share the same ranking of firms, and secondly, agents do not necessarily meet all firms, whether small or large, at the same rate. By relaxing these assumptions and building a random search model, the paper demonstrates that the structure of frictions, rather than their intensity, is key in understanding market concentration. \n\nUsing unique French customs data, the authors estimated the slope of the meeting rate with respect to firm size and found that an increase in search frictions intensity increased market concentration - up to a certain threshold of frictions.

The missing data is then imputed using multiple factors estimated from the high frequency data. \n\nThe paper compares the effectiveness of static matrix completion and dynamic procedures for imputing missing values.

This paper examines the role of reinsurers, data sharing, and risk tolerant capital in developing a sustainable market.","intro":"As our world becomes more reliant on technology, the threat of cyber-attacks grows stronger. In response, the cyber-insurance market has emerged, offering protection to businesses and individuals alike. However, this market faces several challenges that must be overcome in order to ensure its sustainability. This paper explores these challenges and proposes solutions for a more efficient and effective cyber-insurance market.","text":"One of the main barriers to sustainable risk transfer in the cyber-insurance market is the constantly evolving nature of cyber threats. Unlike other types of insurance, where historical data can be used to predict future losses, the cyber-insurance market must constantly adapt to new and unpredictable threats. This makes it difficult for insurers to accurately price their products and for reinsurers to provide risk tolerant capital.\n\nAdditionally, there is a lack of data sharing in the cyber-insurance market. Without a centralized incident reporting system, insurers and reinsurers must rely on public data and their own internal data to make decisions. This limits their ability to accurately assess risk and price their products. However, the artificial market simulations developed in this paper show that better data sharing leads to more efficient outcomes.\n\nAnother challenge facing the cyber-insurance market is the limited involvement of reinsurers. When loss expectations are not shared, reinsurers are less likely to provide risk tolerant capital, which leads to increased premia and lower overall capacity. The simulations show that the involvement of reinsurers is crucial for developing a sustainable cyber-insurance market.\n\nIn order to overcome these barriers and develop a sustainable cyber-insurance market, this paper proposes several solutions. Firstly, there needs to be better data sharing between insurers and reinsurers. This could be achieved through a centralized incident reporting system or through collaborative efforts between industry stakeholders. Secondly, the involvement of reinsurers needs to be increased, particularly when loss expectations are not shared. This can be achieved through the development of risk pools or the use of alternative risk transfer mechanisms.\n\nIn conclusion, while the cyber-insurance market is still in its infancy, it has the potential to play a crucial role in protecting businesses and individuals from the growing threat of cyber-attacks.

By leveraging this powerful technique, scientists have developed a novel method for analyzing partially linear models under data combination.
