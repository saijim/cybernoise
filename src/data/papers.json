This method is both fast and scalable, allowing the platform to analyze a vast amount of data in real-time and provide accurate predictions within seconds. \n\nTo test the framework's effectiveness, the authors used a large-scale dataset from a European on-demand delivery platform, consisting of demand data from various geographical regions, different periods (i.e., pre- and post-COVID), and loss functions. The results show that the AI forecasting framework outperformed several industry benchmarks in all cases, achieving impressive performance gains that translated into significant financial and operational benefits. For instance, the financial gains obtained from faster and more accurate deliveries were estimated at over $10 million per annum, while the computational cost of using the framework was reduced by up to 90%.

By disclosing their experiences with the institution or merely observing each other's actions, these agents evolve their beliefs about the institution and the trust they place in it over time. \n\n    Through simulations, the study found that a pair of agents working together has a greater chance of learning the true trustworthiness of an institution than a single agent working alone. Communication between agents promotes the formation of long term trust with a trustworthy institution as well as the timely exit from a trust relationship with an untrustworthy institution. Surprisingly, the study found that sometimes having less information can be more beneficial to the agents.

Firstly, better data sharing mechanisms for cyber incidents could reduce the negative impact of diverse loss distributions on the market's efficiency. Secondly, external sources of risk tolerant capital for cyber-insurance markets could ensure that sufficient coverage is available to those seeking to transfer cyber risks in the absence of data sharing and the resulting efficient markets.

They provide methods for inference in an asymptotic framework where the number of clusters tends to infinity and treatment is assigned using a covariate-adaptive stratified randomization procedure. Additionally, the experimenter can sample only a subset of the units within each cluster rather than the entire cluster, and the paper demonstrates the implications of such sampling for some commonly used estimators. \n\nTo test the practicality of their theoretical results, the authors carried out a small simulation study, which showed that their approach performs better in terms of coverage probabilities and root mean squared errors than alternative methods, especially when the cluster size variability is large.
