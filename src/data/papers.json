        "summary": "A new method has been developed to mitigate AI model bias caused by debiasing challenges by designing a reverse artificial bias created through a backdoor attack. This solution, validated on both image and structured datasets, shows promising results and highlights the potential for beneficial applications.",
        "intro": "Artificial intelligence has been utilized in various social situations, but it has been discovered that some algorithms exhibit biases, providing unequal results. Researchers have found a new method to fight against these biases - through backdoor attacks.",
        "text": "In the world of artificial intelligence, it's crucial to ensure that algorithms are not biased towards any particular group. However, the current debiasing methods face a lot of challenges such as poor utilization of data or intricate training requirements. To combat this issue, researchers have turned to backdoor attacks. By designing reverse artificial bias created through a backdoor attack, the team was able to mitigate the model bias that was derived in standard training. This resulted in a backdoor debiasing framework based on knowledge distillation which effectively reduces the model bias from original data and minimizes security risks from the backdoor attack. They have used both image and structured datasets to validate the solution and it resulted in promising results. This new method highlights the potential for beneficial applications of backdoor attacks.",

Ternary quantization can help address this issue by compressing neural network models without sacrificing inference speed or accuracy. This article provides a comprehensive survey of the evolution and optimization methods of ternary quantization.",
        "intro": "Artificial intelligence is revolutionizing countless industries, but deploying deep neural networks can be a bottleneck due to their computational complexity. Fortunately, researchers have developed techniques to compress neural network models without sacrificing performance. One of the most promising and efficient methods is ternary quantization.",
        "text": "Ternary quantization is a process of converting individual float values of layer weights to low-precision ones, typically reduced to -1, 0, or 1. By reducing the precision of the weights, computational overhead is minimized, and inference time is improved, with negligible loss of accuracy. The origins of ternary quantization date back to studies that aimed to reduce the storage capacity of neural networks. Various ternary functions have been proposed in the literature, such as ternary weight network (TWN), ternary activation network (TAN), and ternary neural network (TNN). Each of these methods has its pros and cons, mainly depending on the projection function used and the optimization method applied. This survey focuses on ternary quantization, mapping out its evolution and the relationships among existing methods.",

Subjective and objective experiments showed that the model exceeded two state-of-the-art controllable TTS models in controllability, emotion expressiveness, and naturalness.\n\nThe implications of this model are far-reaching. Virtual assistants can now have nuanced emotional responses to better serve their users. In storytelling, authors can create immersive experiences with emotionally expressive narrations.

Using advanced AI technologies such as CLIP and Sentence BERT, combined with ResNet50, we achieved a weighted average F1 score of 0.8079, becoming the runners-up in FACTIFY2.",
        "intro": "In today’s age of information overload, fake news has become a big problem. Social media is the epicenter of this phenomenon, where unverified news and rumors can spread rapidly and cause mass panic. To combat this, we’ve developed a cutting-edge AI fact verification system that uses structural coherence to separate fact from fiction. Read on to learn more about our approach to FACTIFY2, where we achieved great success!",
        "text": "Our structure coherence-based multi-modal fact verification system is based on the idea that there should be a structural coherence between the claim and the document. To achieve this, we employ four different aspects, including sentence length, vocabulary similarity, semantic similarity, and image similarity. We combined the power of CLIP and Sentence BERT to extract text features and ResNet50 to extract image features, which were then concatenated and passed through the random forest classifier. In addition to these features, we also extract the length of the text and the lexical similarity, all of which were critical to our success in the FACTIFY2 challenge.\n\nOur multi-modal fact verification approach is novel because of its emphasis on the structure coherence of a claim and its supporting evidence. By incorporating both image and text features, we could identify fake news stories that would have been overlooked by systems based solely on text data. Our weighted average F1 score of 0.8079 was good enough to earn us the second spot in the fact verification challenge, an achievement that further highlights the effectiveness of our approach.\n\nLooking forward, we’re constantly striving to improve our AI fact verification system to ensure that it remains at the leading edge of combating fake news. We believe that by continuing to develop our approach and incorporating new technologies, we can be even more successful in the future. The fight against fake news is far from over, but we’re confident that we’re making significant progress in the cyber world.",

In this article, we explore the potential of learning machines for not only personalized healthcare but also beyond.",
        "text": "Machine learning models are incredibly effective at identifying patterns in large datasets, making them useful for predicting health outcomes and improving patient care. For example, a model could be trained to identify symptoms or risk factors associated with certain diseases, allowing healthcare providers to intervene earlier and potentially prevent the onset of these diseases altogether. However, a model's effectiveness is not fixed at the point of publication or deployment. Patient demographics and health trends are constantly changing, meaning that a model that works well in one location may not work as well in another. That's why ongoing maintenance and monitoring of these models is critical for ensuring their long-term effectiveness and safety in patient care. \n\nBeyond personalized healthcare, learning machines have the potential to impact a wide range of industries. Predictive models could be used to optimize supply chains, reduce waste, and improve efficiency in manufacturing. They could also be used to make more accurate weather predictions or even develop smarter transportation systems that reduce traffic and carbon emissions. The possibilities are endless.\n\nHowever, the development and deployment of these models is not without its challenges. Data privacy concerns and biases in training data must be addressed to ensure that learning machines are used ethically and to their fullest potential. Additionally, ongoing education and training will be necessary to ensure that healthcare providers and other industry professionals are equipped with the knowledge and skills to effectively use and interpret these models. \n\nDespite these challenges, the potential of learning machines for improving patient care and beyond is too great to ignore.

The approach has been tested on models designed for Story Visualization and Scene Synthesis with promising results.",

Rather than measuring images using pixels, the framework - which has been called the Counterfactual Edit Framework - uses concepts as the basis for evaluation. Meanwhile, global explanations produced by accumulating local edits can also reveal what concepts a model cannot generate in total.\n\nThe developers of the framework believe that it is powerful enough to work in the model-agnostic setting. They have applied the framework on various models designed for the challenging tasks of Story Visualization and Scene Synthesis and have received promising results. The application of counterfactual edits helps the researchers to identify what the model is capable of generating and not capable of generating, providing limitations to the researchers.\n\nThe framework works as follows: users identify which objects or attributes should be inserted, removed or replaced in the generated image to approach the desired goal. They can also reveal which templates are not covered by the model. This knowledge will allow scientists to fine-tune the AI models in the future, so that they will be better equipped to generate high-quality images.\n\nThe team behind the framework is optimistic about the future of AI in the field of image generation.

        "text": "With the exponential increase in hardware-software complexity, it has become impossible for humans to manually find the right optimization heuristics for compilers. Predictive models have shown to be a promising solution, but lack of diverse benchmarks to train on poses a severe limitation. Generative AI models have been developed to synthesize benchmarks, but they fall short in producing complex and diverse benchmarks.\n\nEnter BenchPress, the first ML compiler benchmark generator that can be directed within source code feature representations. BenchPress uses active learning to introduce unseen features into the dataset and improves its performance by 50%. We outperform human-written code from GitHub, CLgen, CLSmith, and SRCIROR mutator in targeting features of Rodinia benchmarks. BenchPress uses a beam search over a feature-agnostic language model to steer its generation.\n\nThe team of researchers who developed BenchPress have since improved it with BenchDirect, a directed language model that is capable of infilling programs by jointly observing source code context and targeted compiler features. BenchDirect is up to 36% more accurate in targeting the features of Rodinia benchmarks and is 1.8x more likely to produce an exact match. Furthermore, it speeds up execution time by up to 72% compared to BenchPress. Both BenchPress and BenchDirect's synthetic benchmarks are difficult to distinguish from human-written code. In a Turing Test conducted by the researchers, BenchDirect's synthetic benchmarks were labeled as 'human-written' as often as human-written code from GitHub.\n\nIn conclusion, BenchDirect is a groundbreaking generative AI model that revolutionizes the process of generating compiler benchmarks. With its excellent accuracy and speedy execution time, BenchDirect will help compiler engineers find the right optimization heuristics with little human effort.

To solve this problem, the researchers behind AdaptiveMix turned to a novel perspective, that of robust image classification. They propose a simple yet effective module that shrinks the regions of training data in the image representation space of the discriminator, improving image quality and representing images more accurately.\n\nThe AdaptiveMix algorithm constructs hard samples by mixing a pair of training images, then shrinks the feature distance between hard and easy samples to make GAN training more stable. Extensive experiments on seven publicly available datasets show that their method boosts the performance of baselines, improving the quality of generated samples and enabling GANs to be trained more effectively.\n\nFurthermore, AdaptiveMix can be applied to other tasks beyond GAN training. By equipping it with other state-of-the-art methods, it can be applied to image classification and Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) detection tasks, boosting the performance of baselines on these tasks as well.\n\nIn conclusion, AdaptiveMix is a promising new approach to GAN training that improves image quality, makes training more stable, and promises to revolutionize the field of machine learning.

        "summary": "Researchers have discovered the mechanism of how the Ustilago maydis fungus causes common smut in maize: Sts2 effector protein is responsible for promoting division of tumor cells in the host plant. Sts2 acts as a transcriptional activator upon invading the maize cell nucleus and activating the expression of developmental regulators, and its transactivation is crucial for its virulence function.",
        "intro": "The Ustilago maydis fungus has been causing corn smut for years, resulting in reduced yield and quality of maize crops. But researchers may have found a way to outsmart this pathogenic intruder. In a breakthrough study, scientists have discovered a protein, Sts2 effector, that fuels the growth of tumors induced by the fungus in maize plants. Its discovery could lead to the development of an effective treatment against the destructive fungus, and even give hope for potential uses of this protein in biotechnology and oncology.",
        "text": "Ustilago maydis is a fungal plant pathogen that causes the formation of tumors or galls in maize plants by promoting hyperplasia or abnormal cell growth. The molecular mechanisms behind this process have been largely unknown until now. To understand how U. maydis induces tumor formation, researchers from Europe and America characterized the fungal effector protein Sts2 and its interaction with the maize plant. Sts2 was found to promote tumor development by activating the transcription of several genes associated with leaf development in maize. The researchers discovered that Sts2 contains a functional nuclear localization signal and enters the host plant cell nucleus, where it activates the expression of various regulators that stimulate tumor growth. The study also identified one of the interacting maize proteins, ZmNECAP1, as a transcriptional activator that interacts with Sts2 and potentiates its virulence. In addition, the study revealed the essential role of leaf developmental regulators in pathogen-induced tumorigenesis in maize.\n\nThe researchers generated transgenic maize plants expressing Sts2 and found that they induced similar tumor phenotypes as the fungus; the tumor cells exhibited increased proliferation, but decreased differentiation, suggesting that Sts2 specifically suppresses a developmental process that was associated with differentiation in maize cells. The researchers also found that the expression of several genes encoding regulatory proteins controlling leaf development was significantly upregulated in Sts2-expressing maize leaves. On the other hand, fusion of an SRDX-motif, which represses transcriptional activation, to Sts2 caused a dominant-negative inhibition of tumor formation, confirming the central role of Sts2 in tumorigenesis.\n\nWhile the Sts2 effector protein is only associated with fungal pathogenesis, the study may have implications for future biotechnological or oncological research. Sts2 is a transcriptional activator protein that can interact with plant transcription factors, which suggests that this protein could activate plant developmental processes or activate genes that are involved in stress response, for example, as a result of exposure to pathogens or other stressors. The use of effector proteins as gene regulatory tools is an active area of research, and Sts2 could be used in the future to produce transgenic crops or plants with specific gene expression patterns. Additionally, the transcriptional activity of Sts2 is reminiscent of some human proteins, raising the possibility that the tumor-promoting activity of Sts2 could be harnessed and developed for future oncological treatments.",

        "summary": "The resilience of Canadian hard red spring wheat (Triticum aestivum) cultivars to drought has long been attributed to osmotic adjustment, but a scientific study reveals that sustained crop yield under limited soil water in these areas is mainly due to tight stomatal behavior, early leaf roll, and leaf hydration. Even without osmotic adjustment, the cultivars can secure kernel weight and leaf hydration status under periods of drought.",
        "intro": "As climate change exacerbates the frequency and intensity of drought events, the persistent productivity of Canadian wheat cultivars amid limited soil water has become a pressing concern. The ability of wheat to sustain its crop yield under drought, which was mainly linked to osmotic adjustment or OA, was put to the test. A recent study shows that OA may not be the main driver of drought tolerance, contrary to what has been previously hypothesized, but it's the stomatal behavior and leaf rolling that keeps the leaf hydration status and kernel weight intact amidst drought conditions.",
        "text": "Researchers have examined the drought tolerance of Canadian Western Red Spring (CWRS) cultivars - Superb, Stettler, and AAC Viewfield - by measuring osmotic adjustment, stomatal behavior, leaf rolls, kernel weight, and hydration status under controlled drought conditions. The hypothesis was that OA, which is the plant's ability to accumulate solutes within the cell to maintain turgor pressure and prevent water loss, was the primary mechanism by which wheat sustains its crop yield under drought.<br><br> However, the results suggest that OA may not be the most critical factor in drought tolerance. Instead, tight stomatal behavior and early leaf rolling were identified as the key traits enabling the wheat cultivars to maintain high hydration status even under limited soil water. Stomata are specialized pores in plant leaves that help regulate gas exchange and the water balance, and their efficient transition from onset to full closure allows wheat to maintain its hydration levels even under stress.<br><br>Moreover, the onset of drought-induced kernel weight loss coincided with marked reductions in the leaf hydration status ({Theta}RWC) in all three cultivars. The early leaf rolling of plants also aided in securing kernel weight even at the reduced water supply by allowing the preservation of residues in the flagged leaves. <br><br> The study emphasizes the importance of analyzing multiple traits to fully understand the mechanisms underlying drought tolerance. It also provides valuable insights into how Canadian wheat cultivars can yield resiliently even as drought episodes become harsher due to climate change.",

This protein has a high affinity for Cu+ ions and is primarily located in the cytosol, near the plasma and symbiosome membranes, and within nuclei.\n\nMutant ncc1 plants were studied, and it was found that they had a severe reduction in nitrogenase activity, as well as a 50% reduction in copper-dependent cytochrome c oxidase activity.

Deleting a specific part of the PIF4 gene in rice cultivars leads to a drastic reduction in water-use efficiency, while overexpressing this gene increases rice's iWUE (intrinsic water use efficiency) by up to 25%.",

        "text": "Rice is a key crop in many parts of the world, but it requires large amounts of water to grow. To address this challenge, a team of researchers investigated ways to improve the intrinsic water use efficiency (iWUE) of a subcategory of rice called Minicore rice. They analyzed five parameters of iWUE under fluctuating light (FL) in 200 Minicore rice accessions and identified a novel trait called WUEFL, which has the highest SNP heritability in these parameters. Further analysis led to the discovery of PIF4, a gene that is highly expressed in high iWUEFL rice subgroups.",

        "summary": "A recent study has revealed that the transcription factor ERF1 plays a vital role in regulating lateral root emergence in plants. By altering the distribution of auxin and repressing ARF7 expression, ERF1 ensures that plants can efficiently absorb nutrients and respond to environmental stressors.",
        "intro": "Plants are masters of adaptation, able to survive in some of the harshest environments on Earth. Scientists have long been fascinated by the complex mechanisms that plants use to respond to changes in their surroundings, and recent research has shed new light on the role of ERF1 in regulating lateral root emergence for optimal growth.",
        "text": "Lateral roots are essential for the absorption of nutrients and water, as well as for sensing environmental signals. However, the intricacies of the mechanisms underlying lateral root formation are not yet fully understood. Previous studies have shown that auxin plays a vital role in regulating lateral root emergence, but the precise mechanisms by which this occurs have remained elusive.\n\nEnter ERF1, a transcription factor that has been described as a 'hub' in the plant stress response. In recent research conducted by a team of plant scientists, it was discovered that ERF1 is a key regulator of lateral root formation. The study found that ERF1 inhibits lateral root emergence by promoting local accumulation of auxin in specific areas of the plant, leading to altered distribution of this crucial hormone.\n\nOne of the ways that ERF1 achieves this is by directly upregulating the expression of PIN1 and AUX1, both of which are involved in auxin transport. By enhancing both acropetal and basipetal transport, ERF1 ensures that auxin accumulates in specific regions, such as the endodermis, cortex, and epidermis. These regions correspond to areas where new primordia are likely to emerge, and excessive auxin accumulation leads to the inhibition of lateral root emergence.\n\nIn addition to regulating auxin transport and distribution, ERF1 also plays a role in auxin signaling. By repressing the transcription of ARF7, which is involved in cell wall remodeling (CWR) genes that facilitate lateral root emergence, ERF1 effectively controls the rate of lateral root branching and emergence. The researchers found that ERF1 directly regulates the expression of PIN1, AUX1, and ARF7 by binding to their promoters, thus playing a crucial role in the complex network of genes and proteins that control plant adaptation.\n\nTaken together, these findings demonstrate the central role that ERF1 plays in regulating lateral root emergence and branching in response to environmental stressors. By fine-tuning the distribution of auxin and repressing the transcription of ARF7, ERF1 helps to optimize plant growth and survival in harsh environments. Unlocking these secrets of plant adaptation may have far-reaching implications for agriculture and environmental management, offering new avenues for sustainable and resilient plant-based systems.",

        "summary": "A eubiotic microbiota is crucial for the proper development of the immune response in plants. A recent study has shown that Arabidopsis grown without a natural microbiota exhibited hypersusceptibility to infections, which could be restored by introducing a healthy synthetic microbiome.",
        "intro": "Could the key to improving plant immunity lie in their microbiomes? According to a recent study, plants grown without a natural microbiota were found to be more susceptible to infections. However, the introduction of a healthy synthetic microbiome can significantly restore plant immunity, marking a breakthrough in plant biology and agriculture.",
        "text": "When we think about plant immunity, we often focus on plant genetics rather than environmental factors such as soil and microbes. However, recent research has demonstrated that the health of a plant's microbiome is critical in regulating its immune response. The study, conducted at a university, utilized a new cultivation technique called the peat-based gnotobiotic plant growth system, which allowed researchers to examine the effects of a healthy and a dysbiotic microbiome on Arabidopsis thaliana. \n\nThe results showed that when Arabidopsis was grown in the absence of a natural microbiota, the plant lacked age-dependent maturation of the immune response and was more susceptible to infection by the foliar bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato DC3000. The introduction of a healthy synthetic microbiome, composed of 48 culturable bacterial strains from the endosphere of healthy Arabidopsis plants, significantly restored the plant's immunocompetence. The microbiota introduced, when compared to the soil-derived community, showed similar levels of restoration in plant immunity. However, a dysbiotic synthetic microbiome comprised of 52 different bacterial strains overstimulated the immune transcriptome in the plant. \n\nThe findings suggest that a balanced, eubiotic microbiota is critical to gating proper immunocompetence and age-dependent immunity in plants. Moreover, the richness of the nutrient environment in soil could suppress microbiota-mediated immunocompetence. Overall, the study highlights the importance of microbiota diversity in plants and the potential for synthetic microbiomes to improve plant immunity and protect them from diseases. \n\nThis breakthrough in plant biology and agriculture opens up new possibilities in precision farming, plant breeding and sustainable agriculture. It could lead to the development of targeted probiotics and prebiotics, which can help support a plant's natural microbiome and enhance its immunity. Moreover, the research could pave the way for natural and organic methods of disease control, reducing the use of synthetic chemicals and pesticides.",

        "text": "Plant defense responses involve a complex interplay of mechanisms and processes that allow plants to detect and respond to pathogens. For years, researchers have sought to understand how different cells within organs work together to coordinate these responses. In a recent breakthrough study, scientists used single-cell RNA sequencing to identify ten distinct cell populations within Arabidopsis leaves that respond to the bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas syringae DC3000.\n\nThe team of scientists identified several major cell types within the leaves, including mesophyll, guard, epidermal, companion, and vascular S cells. By analyzing transcriptional dynamics, the researchers found that each of these cell types exhibit characteristic defense responses, with regulators that specify different cell-type responses to the pathogen. In addition, the scientists discovered that these cells can share similar modules of gene reprogramming that allow for the convergence of different cells types towards an identical cell fate characterized by lignification and detoxification functions.\n\nFurther analyses of transcriptional dynamics, based on inference of cell trajectories, indicated that the defense responses of vascular S cells, epidermal cells, and mesophyll cells can evolve along a second separate path. This divergence does not correspond to the differentiation between immune and susceptible cells, but may instead reflect the discrimination between cell-autonomous and non-cell-autonomous responses.\n\nThese findings provide an upgraded framework to describe, explore, and explain the specialization and coordination of plant cell responses upon pathogenic challenge. By understanding how plant immune responses work at a cellular level, researchers may be able to develop new strategies for crop protection that are more efficient and tailored to specific types of pathogens.\n\nIn the future, it may be possible to manipulate the defense responses of different cells within plants to enhance plant immunity and ensure greater yields for crops. The potential benefits of this research are enormous, and could pave the way for a new era of sustainable agriculture that is better equipped to meet the challenges of a changing climate and growing population.",

        "text": "Sterols, a group of molecules that are essential for life, are produced through complex pathways in plants, animals, and fungi. Researchers have long studied plant sterols, as they play important roles in cell biology, signaling, and overall plant development. However, genetic interference with their function can cause developmental defects, making it difficult to manipulate sterol production in plants. That's where clomiphene comes in. Researchers found that this drug, which has previously been used to treat female infertility, also inhibits sterol biosynthesis in plants.\n\nThe researchers tested a collection of inhibitors of mammalian cholesterol biosynthesis to identify new inhibitors of plant sterol biosynthesis. They found that imidazole-type fungicides like bifonazole, clotrimazole, and econazole all inhibit the obtusifoliol 14-demethylase CYP51, which is present in many eukaryotes. But what surprised them was that clomiphene, a selective estrogen receptor modulator used in human fertility treatments, can also inhibit sterol biosynthesis in plants.\n\nFurther experiments showed that clomiphene inhibits the plant-specific cyclopropyl-cycloisomerase CPI1. These findings suggest that rescreening animal sterol biosynthesis drugs can be a fruitful strategy for identifying novel inhibitors of plant sterol biosynthesis.\n\nThis discovery has important implications for agriculture. With clomiphene, researchers now have a new tool to inhibit sterol biosynthesis in plants, which can lead to improved crop yield and quality. This could be especially beneficial for farmers in areas that face food shortages or struggle with pests that damage crops.\n\nWhile more research is needed to determine the optimal use of clomiphene as a plant-specific inhibitor of sterol biosynthesis, this discovery represents a promising new avenue for agricultural research and development.",

However, this is a complex task, especially as climate change creates increasing instability in plant environments. To address this, researchers are turning to Multi-Environment Trials (METs), which provide a more comprehensive view of how genotype and environment interact.

That’s where metaGE comes in. metaGE is a flexible and computationally efficient meta-analysis approach that allows for the joint analysis of any MET GWAS experiment. It accounts for both the heterogeneity of QTL (quantitative trait locus) effects across environments and the correlation between GWAS summary statistics acquired on the same or related set of genotypes.
