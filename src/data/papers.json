        "intro": "Are you tired of worrying about data breaches and hackers sabotaging your machine learning projects? Fear not! Our groundbreaking solution, based on recursive Euclidean distance, is here to protect your data and enhance the accuracy of your global models.",
        "text": "In recent years, federated learning has emerged as a popular method for addressing data availability and privacy challenges in machine learning. Despite its many advantages, federated learning's aggregation process remains vulnerable to malicious attacks, including backdoor poisoning, label-flipping, and membership inference. Such attacks occur when ill-intentioned users train local models with malicious data, hoping to undermine the collaborative learning process. To combat these threats and bolster data security, our team has developed a novel, robust aggregation technique that employs recursive Euclidean distance calculation.\n\nThis innovative approach calculates the distance of local models from the previous global model and assigns weights accordingly. Local models that deviate significantly from the global model receive smaller weights, minimizing the impact of data poisoning during aggregation. As a result, our method offers a more secure, accurate, and efficient solution for federated learning.\n\nIn our experiments, the proposed algorithm outperformed state-of-the-art algorithms by at least 5% in accuracy while reducing time complexity by less than 55%. This breakthrough is particularly significant, as it addresses the urgent need for increased security against malicious attacks in federated learning while enhancing the precision of global models.\n\nAs the world becomes increasingly interconnected and data-driven, the importance of safeguarding sensitive information and maintaining data privacy cannot be overstated. Our groundbreaking recursive Euclidean distance-based approach provides an invaluable tool for those seeking to maximize the benefits of federated learning while minimizing its vulnerabilities. By embracing this cutting-edge technology, you can rest assured that your machine learning projects are protected against malicious attacks and poised for success.\n\nIn conclusion, the future of federated learning is brighter than ever, thanks to our innovative aggregation technique. By leveraging the power of recursive Euclidean distance, we are one step closer to realizing the full potential of machine learning while maintaining robust data privacy and security. It's time to embrace this game-changing technology and transform the world of machine learning for the better.",

        "summary": "Introducing FedMAE, a groundbreaking federated learning framework that harnesses the power of large-scale, unlabeled images using lightweight client devices. Our innovative solution outperforms current methods and paves the way for exciting new applications in self-supervised learning.",
        "intro": "Are you ready to unlock the full potential of your large-scale images without compromising privacy or breaking the bank? Meet FedMAE, our state-of-the-art federated learning framework that tackles the challenges of using unlabeled data in a world where privacy is paramount and resources are limited.",
        "text": "In the realm of federated learning (FL), recent efforts have concentrated on utilizing unlabeled data from clients for training. This trend has emerged due to increasing privacy concerns, high labeling costs, and limited expertise. However, current Federated Semi-Supervised/Self-Supervised Learning (FSSL) approaches struggle to effectively learn from large-scale images, as the limited computing resources of local clients often prove insufficient. To overcome this challenge, we present a novel framework called FedMAE, or Federated Masked AutoEncoder.\n\nFedMAE is designed to efficiently leverage unlabeled, large-scale images for FL. The key to its success lies in its ability to pre-train one-block Masked AutoEncoders (MAEs) using large images on lightweight client devices. Once pre-trained, multiple one-block MAEs are cascaded in the server to build a multi-block ViT backbone for various downstream tasks.\n\nOur theoretical analysis and experimental results demonstrate that FedMAE achieves superior performance when compared to existing FSSL methods. These findings indicate that our innovative approach holds great promise for the future of self-supervised learning, particularly in situations where large-scale images must be utilized without sacrificing privacy or incurring excessive costs.\n\nWith FedMAE, the possibilities for harnessing the power of large-scale images are virtually limitless. This pioneering framework enables users to tap into vast amounts of unlabeled data, unlocking new applications and opportunities in the ever-evolving landscape of federated learning. By providing an effective and efficient solution to the challenges posed by limited resources and privacy concerns, FedMAE is poised to reshape the way we approach self-supervised learning.\n\nIn conclusion, FedMAE represents a significant leap forward in federated self-supervised learning. By combining the advantages of federated learning with the flexibility and efficiency of one-block Masked AutoEncoders, our groundbreaking framework paves the way for exciting new developments in the field. Embrace the future of large-scale image analysis with FedMAE, and unlock the full potential of your data while maintaining privacy and cost-effectiveness.",

This innovative approach offers unparalleled performance, convenience, and scalability compared to traditional invasive methods.",
        "intro": "Imagine a world where detecting diabetes is as easy as wearing a ring. Introducing the HDformer, our cutting-edge solution that takes diabetes detection to new heights by utilizing long-range vascular signals, making early diagnosis more accessible than ever before.",
        "text": "Diabetes mellitus is a global health concern, and early detection is crucial for preventing severe complications. Although low-cost, non-invasive detection methods using cardiovascular signals and deep learning models have emerged, their limited accuracy has hampered widespread clinical adoption. To address this challenge, we present a novel Transformer-based architecture called the Higher Dimensional Transformer (HDformer), which leverages long-range photoplethysmography (PPG) signals for diabetes detection.\n\nLong-range PPG signals contain broader and deeper contextual information compared to the shorter PPG signals commonly used in existing research. To enhance the processing capability and efficiency of long-range data, we introduce a new attention module called Time Square Attention (TSA). This module reduces the volume of tokens by more than 10x while retaining local and global dependencies. It transforms 1-dimensional inputs into 2-dimensional representations, grouping adjacent points into single 2D tokens and utilizing 2D Transformer models as the encoder backbone.\n\nOur approach also incorporates a dynamic patch size into a gated mixture-of-experts (MoE) network as the decoder, optimizing learning on different attention areas. Extensive experimentation demonstrates that the HDformer achieves state-of-the-art performance on the standard MIMIC-III dataset, surpassing existing studies with a sensitivity of 98.4, accuracy of 97.3, specificity of 92.8, and an AUC of 0.929.\n\nThis work represents the first time long-range, non-invasive PPG signals have been employed via a Transformer for diabetes detection, offering a more scalable and convenient solution than traditional invasive methods. Furthermore, the HDformer can be adapted to analyze general long-range biomedical waveforms. To demonstrate the practicality of our approach, we designed a wearable prototype finger-ring as a proof of concept.\n\nIn conclusion, the HDformer is a game-changer in the field of diabetes detection. By harnessing the power of long-range vascular signals and Transformer-based architectures, our innovative solution paves the way for more accessible, accurate, and convenient diabetes detection.

In this work, we present a groundbreaking framework that addresses these concerns by monitoring the computing hardware used for large-scale neural network (NN) training.\n\nThe primary goal of this framework is to provide governments with high confidence that no actor utilizes vast quantities of specialized ML chips to execute training runs in violation of agreed-upon rules. Simultaneously, the system does not limit the use of consumer computing devices and maintains the privacy and confidentiality of ML practitioners' models, data, and hyperparameters.\n\nOur system consists of interventions at three stages: (1) using on-chip firmware to occasionally save snapshots of the neural network weights stored in device memory, in a form that an inspector could later retrieve; (2) saving sufficient information about each training run to prove to inspectors the details of the training run that resulted in the snapshotted weights; and (3) monitoring the chip supply chain to ensure that no actor can avoid discovery by amassing a large quantity of untracked chips.\n\nThe proposed design breaks down the ML training rule verification problem into a series of narrow technical challenges, including a new variant of the Proof-of-Learning problem. By addressing these challenges, our innovative framework paves the way for responsible and secure growth in artificial intelligence, ensuring that advanced ML systems adhere to established rules and agreements.\n\nIn conclusion, the 'Catching Chinchillas' framework represents a significant step forward in the enforcement and verification of rules on large-scale neural network training.

Introducing Reflexion, our state-of-the-art autonomous agent with dynamic memory and self-reflection, bringing us closer than ever to human-like artificial intelligence.",
        "text": "Recent advancements in decision-making large language model (LLM) agents have demonstrated impressive performance across various benchmarks. However, these state-of-the-art approaches typically require internal model fine-tuning, external model fine-tuning, or policy optimization over a defined state space. Implementing these methods can prove challenging due to the scarcity of high-quality training data or the lack of well-defined state space. Moreover, these agents do not possess certain qualities inherent to human decision-making processes, specifically the ability to learn from mistakes. Self-reflection allows humans to efficiently solve novel problems through a process of trial and error.\n\nBuilding on recent research, we propose Reflexion, an approach that endows an agent with dynamic memory and self-reflection capabilities to enhance its existing reasoning trace and task-specific action choice abilities. To achieve full automation, we introduce a straightforward yet effective heuristic that enables the agent to pinpoint hallucination instances, avoid repetition in action sequences, and, in some environments, construct an internal memory map of the given environment.\n\nTo assess our approach, we evaluate the agent's ability to complete decision-making tasks in AlfWorld environments and knowledge-intensive, search-based question-and-answer tasks in HotPotQA environments. We observe success rates of 97% and 51%, respectively, and provide a discussion on the emergent property of self-reflection.\n\nIn conclusion, Reflexion represents a significant breakthrough in artificial intelligence, offering a glimpse into the future of human-like decision-making processes.

We first propose an Informed Posterior Sampling-based RL (iPSRL) algorithm that uses the offline dataset and information about the expert's behavioral policy used to generate the offline dataset. The cumulative Bayesian regret of this algorithm decreases exponentially fast in N, the offline dataset size, if the expert is competent enough.\n\nHowever, this algorithm is computationally impractical, so we introduce the iRLSVI algorithm, a combination of the RLSVI algorithm for online RL and imitation learning. Our empirical results show that the proposed iRLSVI algorithm achieves a significant reduction in regret compared to two baselines: no offline data, and offline dataset but used without information about the generative policy.\n\nBy bridging online RL and imitation learning for the first time, our algorithm offers a promising path toward more efficient and effective learning systems. This innovative approach has the potential to revolutionize the way artificial intelligence learns and adapts in complex environments, paving the way for a new generation of intelligent and versatile AI systems.\n\nIn conclusion, the Bridging Worlds approach combines the strengths of imitation and online reinforcement learning, creating a powerful new learning paradigm.
